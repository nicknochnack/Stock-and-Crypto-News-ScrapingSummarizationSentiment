GME,"Investors in GameStop Corp. GME need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $30.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 65 cents per share to a loss of 73 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

GME,"The WallStreetBets bunch has set their sights on a stock called ContextLogic, with a ticker symbol WISH. ContextLogic is an e-commerce marketplace that matches buyers with sellers. The stock touched on USD 12.10 in today’s trading, and while it has retreated from its highs of the day, shares remain higher by about 3.5%. Retail investors are behind this run after WISH captured their attention. The thing about ContextLogic, however, is that the short interest is unclear. While the major names on their list including GameStop and AMC Entertainment each have a double-digit percentage short interest, increasing the chances for a short squeeze, ContextLogic’s a gray area. The numbers being bandied about are in a wide range, with the high end in the 30% area and the low end at a mere 6%. Traders are laser-focused on unusually high upside call volume in WISH. The USD 12.50 and USD 14 calls expiring on June 18 are among the most popular contracts. There is a great deal of volatility in the stock. Volume is heavier than usual at 111 million shares vs. an average of 27.7 million. The Fed certainly put a damper on the stock market with its inflation and interest rate remarks. The selling has spilled over into some major meme stock names, including GameStop. Shares of GME are headed into the weekend lower by about 2%. The company had some actual news for investors to trade on today. GameStop is reportedly restocking the PS5 on its shelves, but the product is reserved for the gaming company’s loyalty customers who are PowerUp Rewards members. The restock is first-come, first-serve for members and it is unclear whether or not GameStop will open up the restock to the general public. On the trading front, there could be more volatility ahead. According to a Goldman Sachs report cited by Reuters, some USD 818 billion in “single-stock equity options” is set to expire today. The surge in options demand has been a consequence of the retail investor push into meme stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Open interest in single stock options is reportedly hovering at January highs of close to USD 3 trillion based on the notional value, Goldman analysts say.

GME,"Reddit investors pack a powerful punch, just ask hedge fund managers. London-based White Square Capital is shuttering its operations after losses it suffered early in the year from popular meme stock GameStop, according to a report in the Financial Times, citing people close to the situation. White Square, which was founded by Florian Kronawitter, an alum of Paulson & Co, was reportedly short GME. White Square was among the hedge funds to bet against GameStop just about the time that the WallStreetBets revolution was taking hold. The hedge fund got caught in the crosshairs, reportedly experiencing a double-digit percentage decline from the bet and derailing its assets under management (AUM), which at their prime were USD 440 million. Not only have retail investors succeeded in outtrading hedge fund managers, but they have managed to compromise one of the tried and true strategies — equity long/short. Kronawitter reportedly stated: “The decision to close down is related to thinking the equity long-short model is challenged.” The FT source suggests that meme-stock investors were not to blame for White Square’s demise. Meanwhile, White Square’s pain isn’t translating to GameStop’s gain, at least not today, with shares currently trading lower by about 1%. Year-to-date, however, the stock has rallied more than 1,100%. January 2021 was a painful month for short-sellers in GameStop stock. In the month, GME shares suddenly skyrocketed from USD 17 to almost USD 500 at the height of the mania, as retail investors on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum banded together and blindsided short-sellers. Their strategy worked, as retail investors’ profits skyrocketed at the expense of short-selling traders. The target list of highly shorted stocks has since expanded to include movie chain AMC Entertainment, antiquated (but trying to stay relevant) mobile device maker BlackBerry and others. White Square investors will be getting their money back as the sun sets on the firm’s flagship fund. GameStop’s short volume ratio is currently 23%, compared to a lesser 21% for meme stock cousin AMC Entertainment. according to Fintel data. Meanwhile, the volatility in the equity markets is expected to persist for the foreseeable future. Investors have money to burn, after depositing USD 18.5 trillion into bank accounts in Q1 2021 compared to USD 15.8 trillion in the prior-year period. And with such meager returns from savings accounts, equities — including risky meme stocks — remain a compelling option for consumers hunting returns.

GME,"In what has simultaneously been one of Wall Street’s most bizarre and yet transformative phenomena, the rise of meme stocks — loosely defined as publicly traded securities with incredibly strong social media followings — quickly captured the world’s attention. Reportedly, at the heart of this movement’s ethos is the universal desire to restore equity from injustice. But its latest venture could undo whatever good it initially sparked. Kicking off the meme stock spectacle was of course GameStop (NYSE:GME), the video game and consumer electronics retailer. For years, GameStop had struggled for relevance as the underlying industry shifted toward e-commerce revenue channels. Then, the pandemic struck, derailing what was a slight hint of a comeback as GME entered 2020. Not surprisingly, short traders saw a profit-taking opportunity, given GameStop’s many non-pandemic related headwinds. However, chatter spread on social media forum, regarding bearish traders’ overexuberance toward the GME short play. Through coordinated action, the little guys on the opposite side of the trade attempted a short squeeze, or the deliberate bidding up of a stock to force short traders to cover their position, thereby inducing more bullishness. Such moves, though extremely risky, can be extraordinarily lucrative. As Jamie Cohen, a digital culture expert with a PhD in cultural and media studies stated in an interview with Time, this was more than just about profiteering. Rather, it was about fighting back against a corrupt system that average everyday individuals felt contributed to their disenfranchisement. An article from TechCrunch.com added weight to this underlying morality of meme stocks, reporting that social media users relished their newfound contrarianism. To them, this was to some degree revenge, delivering a magnitude of comeuppance that the Occupy Wall Street movement years earlier could not. Later, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) surged on a similar justification. As well, many meme stock participants saw a higher purpose in their market activism, essentially protecting their favorite childhood institutions from the ravages of corporate greed. Indeed, the movement had some level of moral credibility, until it wandered into the lap of Geo Group (NYSE:GEO). (See Geo Group stock chart) As a private prison, Geo Group doesn’t enjoy many overt backers. Even in the best of times, GEO was a controversial investment. Today, it’s considered nearly odious.

GME,"(Corrects paragraph 5 to say Ryan Cohen is chairman, not chief technology officer) June 21 (Reuters) - GameStop Corp, the videogame retailer at the center of this year's ""meme stock"" trading frenzy, named Chief Executive Matt Furlong to its board on Monday, as the former Amazon executive took formal charge of the company. Furlong was named GameStop's CEO earlier this month, succeeding George Sherman who, the company said, also retired from the board. Furlong oversaw a small but growing part of Amazon's business as the country head for Australia, a role his LinkedIn profile said he assumed in May 2019. GameStop has become one of the hottest and most visible ""meme stocks"" followed on social media after its meteoric rise in a Reddit-driven retail short squeeze that caught Wall Street off guard in January.

($1 = 1.3305 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) Related Quotes The company, whose shares are up more than 960% this year, was the spark in January for a battle casting hedge fund short-sellers against a pack of small-time investors organizing online.  Cinema operator AMC Entertainment, another meme play, completed two share issues in three days earlier this month, while Torchlight Energy on Monday upsized its own share sale to $250 million.  GameStop said it would use the net proceeds from the offering, which adds to $551 million it raised in late April, for general corporate purposes as well as for investing in growth initiatives. Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the stock market has embarked on a journey with ups and downs, the likes of which had been unprecedented.

GME,"“Oh people, look around you. The signs are everywhere.” —Jackson Browne It’s the silly season on Wall Street. It’s been the case for a while now, and may continue to be for some time. The economy and markets are awash in money; from stimulus checks, Federal Reserve policy moves and rising wages, all of which are boosting stock prices to record highs. Interest rates are at record lows which is creating, among other things, massive demand for high-yielding junk bonds, sending their yields below the rate of inflation rate for the first time ever. (Low rates are also contributing to the run-up in stocks, as stocks are now the only investment providing any kind of return.) Meanwhile bankers and CEOs are flooding financial markets with initial public offerings, (Krispy Kreme (DNUT), an ill-fated IPO from 20 years ago — which I got wrong — has gone public again) as well as their shadowy cousins, SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies.) Betting against all this froth has proven to be a fool’s errand so far, giving proof yet again to the Wall Street adage: “The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” (An old favorite of mine, whose origin is probably Gary Shilling, not Keynes fyi.) Underlying all this are several factors; for one, an uneven yet mostly strong recovery from COVID-19 (at least in the U.S.), as well as the aforementioned (and some say increasingly unnecessary and potentially counterproductive) assistance from the government. Net net though, this is just another cycle, same as coming out of the fourth wave of the Spanish Flu in 1920. And yet there are at least two factors that are potentially different this time around; cryptocurrency and the meme stock phenomenon. I won’t dwell on crypto — and all of its potential and foibles — here, but will focus instead on meme stocks and more broadly, the so-called retail investor revolution. Before I delve into that though, let me acknowledge that in suggesting something that is unique or new when it comes to the financial markets, triggers another Wall Street aphorism. To wit: “Beware when someone says ‘this time it’s different.’” Meaning, a new business model or trading scheme isn’t really new at its core and the old rules still apply, especially the one that says bubbles always burst. The problem though is that sometimes things really are different. Crypto — rat poison","Fed policy, stimulus checks, wages boosting stocks.

GME,"Stocks jumped on Monday, with the three major indexes recovering some of last week's steep losses as an initial jolt following the Federal Reserve's updated outlook for rates subsided.  The Dow added nearly 600 points, or 1.8%, and had its best day since March. Last week, the index logged a weekly loss of more than 3% in its worst showing since October. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were also each higher on the day.  Treasury yields on the long end of the curve ticked up to recover after a downward slide late last week, and the benchmark 10-year yield ticked back above 1.49% after reaching as high as 1.59% last week. Still, the yield curve has flattened in the wake of the Fed's latest policy update, and the spread between the five and 30-year Treasury yield narrowed to the smallest margin since August Monday morning, according to Bloomberg data.  Traders this week are continuing to reconsider their investments in light of the Federal Reserve's new guidance delivered after policymakers' June meeting last week. In these, Fed officials suggested a higher inflationary path this year and a potentially quicker path to higher interest rates over the next two years. And later in the week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard — typically known for maintaining a ""dovish"" tilt among his colleagues at the central bank — compounded concerns after suggesting inflation risks could warrant a rate hike as soon as next year.  ""The Fed has started the countdown clock to a rate 'liftoff.' Given the pace of the U.S. economic reopening, that’s the only reasonable stance for the central bank to take but it is creating a classic growth scare,"" Nicolas Colas, DataTrek co-founder, wrote in a note Monday morning. ""This is why 10-year Treasury yields are pulling back."" Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound from last year's pandemic-depressed levels.  Despite the monetary policy-driven pullback last week, some strategists remained optimistic about the path forward for U.S. stocks, citing a still-improving economic backdrop.  ""The Fed gave a little bit of a reason for people to kind of take some gains,"" Ross",The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best day since March.

It's been a bad week for ""meme stock"" investors so far, as predictions of doom mounted for stocks with bad business prospects and no profits to fall back on. Meme stocks' bad news actually began a week ago, when investment bank Goldman Sachs observed that retail investors' willingness to risk their money betting on short squeezes -- that might or might not happen -- was waning. In the second quarter, warned the banker, trading volumes at retail brokerages showed as much as a 30% sequential decline in meme stock buying. And of course, it's hard to create a short squeeze without buyers. Result: Meme stocks took a tumble, with Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) closing Thursday down 8.5% from Friday's close, BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) losing 10.4%, and GameStop (NYSE:GME) crashing to a 12.8% loss. Image source: Getty Images. Only in one instance was there actual news to explain the declines. In fact, more than half of GameStop's losses for the week came on just one trading day -- Wednesday -- when Bloomberg reported that Netflix is eying an entry into the video game space, in which it will de facto compete with GameStop. As for the other companies, though -- and as for meme stocks in general -- it's primarily a shift in sentiment against the companies that's weighing on their stock prices. Following up on Goldman's negative take, Franklin Resources CEO Jenny Johnson chimed in on Wednesday with a warning that traders ""could lose everything"" if they persist in buying meme stocks.   Attractive as it might be to think you're ""sticking it to the man"" on Wall Street by buying stocks that ""hedge funds"" are shorting, the simple truth is that neither BlackBerry nor Kodak has earned any profit whatsoever since 2019 -- and GameStop hasn't earned a profit since 2018. ""I never like investing where there isn't fundamentals behind it,"" Johnson told Yahoo! Finance Wednesday. While it's certainly true that a lucky few traders could make -- indeed, have made -- money trying to time the market on meme stocks, there's no underlying value to the companies behind the stock tickers -- no profits.

GME,"As trading platforms like Robinhood create a rise in retail investor market participation and spark a renewed interest in shares of companies dubbed “meme stocks” like GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB), and AMC (AMC), the world of finance is seeing an intersection with the social media sphere. “What you're seeing is a much larger trend here,” Alexis Ohanian, founder of venture capital firm Seven Seven Six and co-founder of Reddit, told Yahoo Finance Live. “It is the intersection of community and capital. It's the intersection of social media and finance.” With online communities such as Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets fueling the meme stock craze, the movement has dismissed concerns of market manipulation. Jaime Rogozinski, who founded the subreddit in 2012, says he did it looking for a more active way to trade investment ideas within a community. The forum now boasts a community of over 10.6 million subscribers. According to Ohanian, it is this sense of community and ease of communication, in tandem with a more accessible user experience for consumers, that has enabled this new era of trading to arise. “At the end of the day now, the user experience—and that's the story of all this—the user experience keeps getting better and better and better for consumers,” Ohanian said. “And so naturally, consumers are going to gravitate towards things that are delightful, and then they also have things at their disposal they never did before, which is real time communication with their friends.” Ohanian, who is leading a $4 million seed-funding round for the new sports-betting startup Wagr, believes that the meme stock movement has demonstrated an investment opportunity in platforms that combine a sense of community around activities like betting or investing. Wagr is an app that aims to wed social media with the gambling market. In addition, Ohanian believes that the rise of the retail investor and meme stock forums has forged a new path for the future of finance. “I'm making big investments in this space, companies like Wagr, because I believe we're going to see in the next 10 years a whole other architecture for finance that's built around community engagement,” Ohanian said. Whether it’s placing wagers on a sporting event or trading stocks, Ohanian says he will continue to invest in platforms that incorporate elements of community engagement. And he does not believe the meme stock movement on Wall Street will be going away anytime soon. “More","‘It’s the intersection of social media and finance,’ Ohanian says.

GME,"Robinhood on Wednesday agreed to pay almost $70 million to settle regulatory allegations that the digital trading platform misled users and approved customers for inappropriately risky trades — though the company did not admit wrongdoing. The settlement marks the latest skirmish between regulators and trading platforms amid the rise of meme stock trading, which has sent shares soaring in companies like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC). The regulatory battle over the retail investing craze will escalate even further, with ""likely"" new rules that aim to protect traders, says Sarah Levy, CEO of Betterment, a digital investing company that favors passive investing and doesn't allow users to hand pick stocks. Levy proposed that the government require that traders receive information to ensure they understand the risks involved in some online investing. ""There are some things that technology has obviously advanced in terms of day traders' and investors' ability to sort of band together to drive outcomes,"" says Levy, whose company manages roughly $30 billion in customer assets.  ""But the notion that you're always going to be at sort of the right moment in that groupthink — I think is unlikely,"" she adds. ""So it seems to me that there's likely to be more regulation, and that the government in particular could do a better job of education."" ""Beyond that, I can't really predict the specifics,"" she later adds. ""Because this is really complex, and it's evolving incredibly quickly."" SEC Chair Gary Gensler in House testimony in May criticized apps that ""gamify"" stock trading and the potential conflict of interest for market makers that profit from the execution of high-volume trades, hinting at potential new rules for digital investing platforms. Speaking to an industry conference last month, Gensler rekindled such criticism, saying that the SEC is examining the structures behind the rise of retail investing and the role played by market makers, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Levy expressed some concern about the gamification of stock trading, warning that the practice is ""not always the best thing for investors."" The ease of day trading belies the complex and risky nature of retail investing, Levy warned. ""I think that the biggest challenge is making sure that the regular investor does not get hurt by the system and the tools available to them,"" says Levy, who took over Betterment in December after more than two decades at Viacom and ViacomCBS (VIAC).

GME,"GameStop's (GME) expansion in North America is gathering pace. The specialty retailer of games and entertainment products has entered into a lease agreement for a 530,000 square foot facility as it looks to expand its North American fulfillment network. Reno, Nevada, is home to the new facility scheduled to come into operation in 2022. Setting up a base in Reno is part of the company’s push to position its growing product offerings as it seeks to enhance shipping across the west coast. Expansion into Nevada comes on the heels of GameStop entering into a lease agreement for a 700,000 square foot facility as it also moves to expand its footprint in York, Pennsylvania. (See GameStop stock chart on TipRanks) GameStop raised about $1.13 billion in June by selling up to 5 million shares in the open market. The specialty retailer will use the funds for general corporate purposes as it moves to finance growth initiatives. The capital raised should also shore up the balance sheet. Last Month, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated a Sell rating on the stock with a $50 price target, implying 74.9% downside potential to current levels. While the company has made major changes to its board of directors and leadership, the analyst does not believe the new team has articulated a roadmap for transforming the company. “Nobody is shorting GameStop because I said so…They’re shorting GameStop because they believe it’s fundamentally worth $40 or $50, not $200. They don’t need me to tell them that.” Pachter says. Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Sell based on 1 Buy, 2 Holds, and 3 Sells. The average GameStop price target of $88.33 implies 55.74% downside potential to current levels.

Both stocks were down close to 1%. GameStop has moved to the Russell 1000 index while AMC stayed in the Russell 2000 benchmark. The changes in indices are effective today. While the progress of the video game retailer to the larger index was a near certainty, there were still doubts over the inclusion of the multiplex chain owner.  GameStop, which is trying to reinvent itself as a digital-first distributor of games and related equipment, is the original meme stock. AMC, another stock challenged by changing consumer behavior patterns, joined it in a market frenzy that added billions of dollars in their market cap in the first half of the year. While AMC was badly hit by the closure of its theaters during the pandemic, its outlook has brightened as the U.S. has gradually lifted restrictions on public gatherings.

GME,"Michele Schneider joins Jared Blikre to talk momentum trades and advanced charting on Wed, 7/14 at 2PM EDT  GameStop shares have put investors through the wringer of late, with the stock having shaved off more than one-third of its value since early June. Trading volume is lighter than usual, suggesting that the downturn could have something to do with the summer doldrums. Nonetheless, retail investors are itching for any sign that their favorite meme stock may have finally hit a bottom and is ready for its next upward move. One Reddit member has posted a “Double Down” technical analysis thread on the forum in which they explain how the technical stars could be aligning for a turnaround in GME. The thread has received more than 500 comments. Investors are responding to the fact that GameStop has “formed a candle combo off of support lines” that is reminiscent of previous set-ups that preceded rallies, according to the thread. The last place that retail investors are looking to for direction is analyst firms. Nonetheless, Wall Street continues to weigh in on the meme stock craze. Most recently, Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo more than doubled his price target on GameStop’s stock. The analyst’s 12-month target went from USD 10 to USD 25, which for all intents and purposes seems bullish. Considering that GameStop shares are trading at USD 190, however, the upward revision did little to lift the stock. The gaming industry has been thrust in the spotlight after an unopened copy of a Super Mario 64 game cartridge was sold at an auction for more than USD 1.5 million, setting a new record. While Nintendo is behind Super Mario, the sale was a boon for all of gaming, including GameStop, which is moving away from nostalgia and into the digital age. The Super Mario 64 cartridge dates back to 1996. That was four years before GameStop as the world knows the brand today was born. While the gaming retailer’s history began in the 1980s, it went through an evolution of brands before becoming today’s GameStop. Incidentally, the company is on a new journey to transition from a brick-and-mortar to a digital retailer. Despite the excitement around the game, Super Mario did little to lift the mood of gaming investors.

(NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP), among others. However, these usually go unnoticed in the chaos surrounding meme stocks. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Melvin Capital Management, one of the most well-known hedge funds on Wall Street, lost $6 billion to meme stocks at the beginning of this year and is still down close to 50% year-to-date.  The number represents just a fraction of the total losses that hedge funds have incurred as a result of the Reddit meme stocks this year. The ten biggest hedge fund casualties of the Reddit short squeeze can be accessed here. However, even as the meme stocks single out losers, they have also produced winners. According to a report published by business news publication Bloomberg, Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin made more than $675 million from a meme stock rally, spurred by users on WallStreetBets forum, earlier this year.  It remains to be seen whether retail investors can sustain the momentum they have gained in the battle for market supremacy as inflation threatens interest in volatile growth stocks and hedge funds, keen to respond in kind after being scapegoated as the villains of the finance world, try to assert their dominance.

M1, Webull and Public had restricted transactions for the affected stocks earlier in the day, along with Robinhood. M1, Webull and Public all attributed the restrictions placed on these volatile stocks not to any effort to curb their purchase or sale, but instead cited the costs associated with settling the trades on the part of their clearing firm, Apex. All three platforms employ Apex to clear trades made by users via their platform. In an interview with Webull CEO Anthony Denier, Yahoo Finance confirmed that the restriction was not something the company had any hand in deciding.

GME," In this article, we discuss the 10 hedge funds that profited from Reddit's meme stock craze. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these hedge funds, go directly to the 5 Hedge Funds that Profited from Reddit's Meme Stock Craze. Hedge funds have been reeling from meme stock rallies over the past few months that are orchestrated by retail investors using internet platforms like Reddit to coordinate. Already under heavy pressure from the rise of fintech applications that have made the world of finance more accessible and inclusive, hedge funds have suffered record losses while attempting to short-sell stocks since the beginning of this year. However, the more shrewd hedge fund managers, who realize how the market dynamics are changing, have used the situation to their advantage.  For example, Michael Burry, the chief of Scion Asset Management, was one of the first to bring GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the video game retailer and entertainment products seller, to prominence. He sold his stake, worth around $7 million, in the company in the second quarter of 2019 before reinvesting in the third quarter, pouring $17 million for 3 million shares. Burry also wrote to the board of directors of the firm thrice, asking them to clean up their act. A few months afterwards, these pleas caught the attention of Redditors.  These Redditors then drove one of the biggest stock rallies of the year, and the price of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), another firm in a similar situation, surged by over 500% in a matter of days. Some of the meme stocks presently popular on WallStreetBets, a 10-million strong Reddit forum, can offer investors an insight into what sectors of the market can expect increased volatility in the next few weeks. Hedge funds, wary of these stocks, are also actively tracing Reddit forums to stay updated.  AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), the Kansas-based movie theatre firm, and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) have survived the short-selling attempts and remain priced higher than hedge funds might have expected after the initial meme stock rally in January. They have made hundreds of millions in profits to some funds, which are discussed in detail below, but have also resulted in losses worth more than $6 billion to others.

The post-pandemic marketplace, already under heavy strain amid fears of inflation and a dramatic drop in the prices of growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, has been thrown into more confusion in recent days as meme stock rallies, fueled by retail investor bets against the short-selling attempts of hedge funds, return to the fore. At the turn of the year, these meme stock rallies led to billions in losses for big finance capital, leading to regulatory probes and calls for policing around trading on applications like Robinhood.  Six months ago, the two primary actors at the center of the hedge fund versus retail investor battle were GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the video game and entertainment products retailer, and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), the movie theatre chain based in Kansas. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the focus of a short-selling attempt in early January, saw share price rise close to 1,500% in the first three weeks of the new year as retail investors, who used Reddit forum WallStreetBets to coordinate, spoiled hedge fund bets against the stock.  Similarly, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) was also the target of a short-seller scheme this year. The company has recently been involved in another short squeeze as the share price registers double digits growth amid reports that many shares of the firm are being held short. On June 19, data from finance firm Ortex showed that short-sellers had lost more than $500 million after a rally saw the share price of the movie theatre firm jump by close to 15% in a single day as a result of coordinated action through social media.  Even though GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) have grabbed all the headlines around Reddit trading and the power of the influencers on WallStreetBets forum, some other stocks that remain popular on the platform, some of which are listed below, include Tesla, Inc.

GME,"Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the stock market has embarked on a journey with ups and downs, the likes of which had been unprecedented. As the saga goes, the virus set in, and people were at home and looking for entertainment. This, coupled with the hopeful possibility of building wealth directly from one’s phone and/or couch, brought a new generation of retail traders to the market. They began to push speculative equities and securities around in their search for quick value. The trading platform Robinhood has been central to this stock market tale, allowing commission-free trading with a streamlined, easy-to-use mobile application to “democratize finance for all,” as is its motto. Its popularity culminated in a one-in-a-lifetime short squeeze in late January 2021, wherein highly motivated Reddit users attempted, and succeeded, to push up the price of GameStop Corp. (GME) stock in order to force hedge funds to cover their massively shorted shares. This particular instance brought about massive negative sentiment for the growing financial application company, as Robinhood was forced to halt buy orders for several high volatility stocks in order to not go bankrupt themselves. The phenomenon brought Robinhood into global headlines and even had U.S. government officials using terms like “meme stocks.” Critics of Robinhood’s platform accuse it of gamifying the stock market with a sensationalizing user interface, and essentially creating an accessible and legal casino for anyone willing to play. The app allows users to quickly trade even the most leveraged and risky positions, including complex derivatives such as options and other financial tools. While other similar mobile platforms also allow this, Robinhood users go through much less data and cautionary information before having their trades executed. Despite the bad press, including congressional hearings with Robinhood’s CEO, the platform has since continued to grow its user base. Keeping an eye on retail traders’ interest in stocks has become a full-time job, and can mean the difference between massive gains or just another week of FOMO. Many websites provide trending stock tickers or even analytics on subreddit mentions of publicly traded companies. As Robinhood is mostly used by younger retail traders, looking at its top-traded stocks can provide insight into what direction certain stocks may be going.

GME,"Top tips on a clever way to reduce your monthly mortgage repayments The GameStop (NYSE:GME) share price continues to defy expectations. Over the last 12 months, even with the high level of volatility, the stock is up nearly 4,600%. And just last week, it continued its upward trajectory, jumping by a further 10% in the first hours of trading on Tuesday. What caused this recent surge? And could it be that GameStop is a worthwhile long-term investment for my portfolio? Let’s take a closer look. The pandemic decimated a large portion of the retail industry. And for GameStop, it proved to be a complete catastrophe. But the video games retailer was in a struggling position long before Covid-19 entered the picture. After all, with most gamers buying and downloading their games digitally, the need for GameStop’s physical stores has been dwindling. In an attempt to save the business, Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of the online pet food business Chewy, has been brought on as the new chairman of the board. His vision is to transform the company into the Amazon of gaming. Needless to say, that’s quite a challenge. Although it’s worth noting that he managed to pull off something similar for Chewy. Consequently, investors seem to have faith in this new leadership. If Cohen succeeds, then the currently overvalued GME share price may actually be justified. And now that the firm has just finished raising over $1.1bn through the sale of five million shares, its balance sheet has been flooded with cash to fund this enterprise. That appears to be why the GME share price shot up last week. The last time I looked at this business, the financials were quite concerning. Since then, the company’s first-quarter earnings report for 2021 has been published. And there are some encouraging signs of a potential turnaround. Using previously raised capital from shareholders and proceeds from closing stores, long-term debt has been completely eliminated. Meanwhile, this latest round of funding has significantly improved the liquidity position of the business. In other words, GameStop shouldn’t have much trouble meeting its short-term obligations in the near future. And what’s more, sales for the quarter actually saw a 25% increase. Overall, the business seems to be in a much better state than a few months ago. However, as promising as this is, the risks remain exceptionally high, in my opinion.

GME,"GameStop, which is the engine on the meme stock train, has triggered some more fallout in the investment landscape. Most recently, another Wall Street analyst has jumped ship, pausing coverage on the stock as several others did before him. This time it’s Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst for internet and digital media at Baird. Sebastian has reportedly placed a hold on his coverage of GameStop. He had a neutral rating on the stock with a USD 25 price target attached compared to the stock’s current price of USD 210. He blamed the fact that the stock has been trading on social media sentiment instead of its financial condition, interfering with his ability to provide a “reasonable” rating on shares. In addition to the meme stock influence, there has been frustration about a lack of details surrounding GameStop’s transformation to a more digital-friendly platform. The gaming company, which is known for its brick-and-mortar locations, recently tapped Amazon alum, Matt Furlong, as its new CEO. Sebastian is not the only Wall Street expert to turn their back on the stock, as the field of analysts has been whittled down to a trio of analysts from nine, as Barron’s pointed out. Shares of the gaming retailer might be down 1% today, but they have rallied more than 1,000% year-to-date. GameStop has shaved about 6% from its market cap during the month of June. Short interest in GameStop stock hovers at USD 1.76 billion, according to Predictive Analytics managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky. He details that there are more than 8 million shares shorted, with close to 15% of short interest compared to the float. Meanwhile, there is some controversy surrounding UK-based trading and investing app Trading 212. Social media is looking for clarity on how the broker is treating GameStop shares. Based on user documentation on social media, it appears that Trading 212 is now requiring that users with GME shares allow the broker to lend out the shares or face the consequences. According to Charles Payne, who is at the helm of research firm Wall Street Strategies, those consequences seem to include liquidating, or being “restricted to only closing or selling the position.” GameStop stock appears to be the main target, and users of the platform are crying foul.

GME,"The stock market is no longer only the domain of in-the-know professionals on Wall Street or The City. The rise of eToro, Robinhood, and other such platforms has made the markets accessible to the masses. With low buy-in fees on CFDs of the world’s most popular shares and markets available in just a few clicks, retail traders have firmly arrived at what was traditionally a very private party. The GameStop (NYSE: GME) saga made headlines all over the world. Not only has a new breed of trader arrived, but these tech-savvy, social media-obsessed traders quickly learned that by pooling together their resources, they could disrupt the game and get one over on the big boys. GameStop turned many amateur investors into rich people overnight. And highlighted just how much power and impact a loosely organized newbie gang of traders on Reddit could have if they put their minds and resources to it. For people coming late to the game and looking to get in on the action, there is a great sense of FOMO. Or whatever this would be in the past tense. GameStop already happened. The system will better protect itself from other such attacks. And there isn’t anywhere near the same value in going with the safe trades of your Googles, Facebooks, or Teslas if you want those GameStop-style rapid returns. So, what is a new trader to do? The answer is to do it the old-school way. Look at the fundamentals. Understand the time in which we live. And use your gained knowledge to identify the next big thing before too many others do the same—something like Asia Broadband, Inc. (OTC: AABB), for example. All that Glitters The U.S. Consumer Price Index jumped by 5% in headline inflation in May. This was its most significant rise since 2008, and everybody knows what happened next back then. In times of economic crisis brought about by out-of-control inflation, the markets always suffer. Or at least most of them do. While stocks, funds, and the value of the dollar may dip drastically in hard times, gold often acts as a hedge that tends to rise in value as everything else falters.

Reddit forum WallStreetBets, with a user base of more than 10.6 million, has become one of the influential finance platforms on the internet in the past six months. The forum is used by retail investors to exchange information about the stock market. Over the past six months, the forum has been perhaps the single largest source of instability in the market, spoiling hedge fund shorts that have resulted in billions of dollars in losses to big finance. The forum recently went private, limiting membership only to users approved by moderators.  Some of the stocks presently popular on Reddit platform WallStreetBets include GameStop Corp.

Most of these stocks have high short interest and are the subject of a short squeeze by retail investors as hedge funds try to short-sell. These meme stocks, as they have come to be known, have witnessed record rallies in the past six months, rewarding shareholders with triple-digit returns. The retail investor interest in the stock market has been helped by applications like Robinhood that have made trading easier and more accessible. However, these applications have also become the subject of a tussle between retail investors and big finance as the battle around meme stocks intensifies.

Hedge funds have suffered billions in losses this year in a fierce stock market showdown with retail investors on internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter over the past six months. These battles have usually centered around stocks that the hedge funds attempted to short-sell, inviting the wrath of users on Reddit forums like WallStreetBets, mostly comprising young investors, who bought up stakes in these companies to drive up the share price, initiating a short squeeze and making handsome profits in the process.  Some of the firms involved in this saga include GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: CLOV), among others. According to some media reports, hedge funds have suffered a total of $12 billion in losses in these short-selling schemes. Investment bank Goldman Sachs last year compiled an index of stocks that these retail investors favored. That index has doubled in value over the past few months.  In an analysis, released to clients earlier this month, the investment bank highlighted that the retail favorites index had beaten the overall market by three percentage points this month. The analysis also underlined that retail investor spending into equities was poised to rise to $400 billion this year, an increase of $50 billion from a previous estimate of $350 billion. Perhaps this is one reason why hedge funds have been actively monitoring the hype around certain companies on Reddit in order to better manage their risk profiles.  The battle, though, still looks to be far from over. According to Goldman Sachs, the retail investor boom in equities is just beginning. Hedge funds managers, like Andrew Left, who expected retail investors to jump ship and drive the price of shorted stocks down, have been left red-faced as the prices of these stocks — referred to as meme stocks — continues to soar higher.

GME,"(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. will join the FTSE Russell 1000 Index of large-capitalization stocks and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. will remain in the Russell 2000 after both companies saw billions of dollars added to their market values amid frenzied rallies this year. GameStop will be transferred into the Russell 1000 and out of the Russell 2000 as part of FTSE’s annual reconstitution, according to a list released by the global index provider on Friday. Due to the timing of a rally in its shares, AMC will remain in the Russell 2000 despite having a current market value of $27.8 billion, which is almost twice GameStop’s and more than nearly two-thirds of the companies in the Russell 1000. The newly balanced indexes will begin trading on Monday. The odd arrangement is due to the timing of FTSE Russell’s cutoff for data used to determine which companies qualify for each index, which was May 7. At the time, the movie-theater chain owner was valued at $4.3 billion. Since then, however, the stock has attracted a cult-like following among meme stock investors, who have helped drive the stock skyward. In typical years, the annual rebalancing of the Russell indexes is a big day for stocks moving in and out of the benchmarks and a non-event for ivnestors whose asset allocation isn’t tied to the revamp. The rise of meme stocks makes this year a somewhat different story. The reshuffle will mean further deterioration in quality of the Russell 2000’s components with the proportion of profit generating companies in the index falling to the lowest in more than 20 years, said Jefferies LLC’s Steve DeSanctis. AMC, which will be the Russell 2000’s largest member, has lost money for seven-consecutive quarters. “The gap between the haves and the have-nots in the index is becoming wider, which will open a lot of opportunities for stock pickers on the right side of the trade,” DeSanctis said in an interview. “The volatility in the Russell 2000 will likely go up because of the universe of companies it will consist of.” Whereas GameStop’s volatility has had a notable effect on the Russell 2000 and related exchange-traded funds this year, it will probably have little impact on the large cap index, whose weightings are dominated by megacap companies like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., according to Mike Dickson, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments. “It’s not going to matter",AMC will remain in the Russell 2000 despite having a market value of $27.8 billion.,NEGATIVE,0.9724528193473816
GME,"Robinhood Markets filed for an initial public offering and released its Form S-1 Thursday, in a highly anticipated move that gave investors a new look at the company’s finances. One risk identified in the S-1 is the company’s heavy reliance on cryptocurrency transactions, especially given their inherent volatility. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), one of the more fluctuant, newer cryptocurrencies, represented a substantial portion of the company’s recent revenue growth. Dogecoin experienced turbulent growth in 2021, at one point rising over 400% in one week. With much of the increase in crypto transactions attributed to the digital currency, a fall in Dogecoin activity could spell trouble for Robinhood’s bottom line. “If demand for transactions in Dogecoin declines and is not replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,” the company said in its S-1. Fully 17% of the company's revenue in Q1 2021 involved cryptocurrency transactions, a significant increase from the 4% for Q4 2020. Regulations pertaining to the crypto market could negatively impact Robinhood’s future earnings, the report said. “Future regulatory developments are impossible to predict with certainty,” the company said. “Changes in laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, may negatively impact our ability to allow customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies with us in the future and may significantly and adversely affect our business.” The company also highlighted cybersecurity risks identified by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in July of 2020. These risks included a number of “matters requiring attention focused primarily on anti-money laundering and cybersecurity-related issues.” Other risks identified in the S-1 include the ‘meme stock’ frenzy, a phenomena that arose last year most notably with GameStop (GME). Robinhood sparked controversy last January when the company temporarily restricted or limited its customers’ purchase of certain securities after retail investors massively increased the value of GameStop and AMC (AMC) stocks. Dozens of class-action lawsuits were filed against Robinhood in response. The trading restrictions were placed on AMC and GameStop, along with other speculative securities, in an effort to ensure Robinhood had enough funds to cover regulatory minimums and other user trading requirements.

GME," Meme-stock and cryptocurrency investors alike are speculating on Twitter about whether today is the day that the company will introduce a non-fungible token, or NFT. Non-fungible tokens are digital assets that integrate some object, such as a piece of artwork, video, or anything that the creator can imagine, including a game apparently. Based on the source code of a GameStop blockchain contract, July 14 had emerged as the speculative launch date for the NFT. That theory is losing its luster, however, as the clock continues to tick. That doesn’t mean that a GameStop NFT isn’t in the works. A GameStop NFT website has already been launched, fueling the speculation that the unveiling of the gaming token is not too far behind. Plus the company recently brought on Matthew Finestone as head of blockchain. Investors are anxiously awaiting the details of what the digital token will have to offer and have begun to unpack the coding tied to a cryptocurrency wallet address for clues. Solidity developer and Twitter account @0xfoobar is reportedly behind the GameStop blockchain contract and has seemingly been busy building the NFT. The GameStop team has been keeping the details of a gaming NFT close to the vest, but the launch could be tied to the Ethereum network upgrade. Gaming is a natural fit for NFTs, given that gamers are already accustomed to buying in-game virtual assets like skins, currency and more to up the ante. The most popular NFTs have been known to sell for tens of millions of dollars. A GameStop NFT could generate some excitement both in the blockchain industry and among traditional gamers, which has the potential to spill over into the stock to give it a much-needed jolt. GameStop, the meme stock that started it all, has seen its value decline by close to 20% in the month of July so far. Year-to-date, shares of GameStop have gained more than 800%.

GME,"(Bloomberg) -- If you think a rush by companies to sell their shares is a bad omen for the market, imagine a scenario where most of the sales come from firms that don’t make money. It’s happening now. Since the end of March, almost 100 unprofitable companies, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., have raised money through secondary offerings, twice as many as coming from profitable firms, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Granted, troubled companies are tapping into buoyant demand during a 16-month rally to beef up their balance sheets. And it’s further evidence that the capital market functions as smoothly as it’s supposed to. Yet some warn that the flood of shares coming from money losers is becoming extreme. During the past 12 months, almost 750 money-losing firms have sold shares in the secondary market, exceeding those that make profits by the biggest margin since at least 1982, data compiled by Sundial Capital Research show. “That perhaps points to companies getting greedy,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “Anytime you have a bunch of selling by desperate companies, that could be a signal we’re closer to a top than a cyclical bottom.” In fact, the previous two periods in which unprofitable firms dominated the pool of equity offerings, the S&P 500 Index was either at the start of a bear market, or already in one. The 2000 episode showed what might be at stake. Back then, a similarly ebullient market lured profitless companies to offer shares. Once supply overwhelmed demand, the party turned into a scare. Stocks with no fundamental support sold off and the carnage spread to the rest of the market. “There can be too much money chasing too little good deals,” said Jeanette Garretty, chief economist at Robertson Stephens Wealth Management. “When the good deals don’t need that money, they start looking for less great deals, and then down the road this is what can lead people to get their fingers burned.” Read more: The Decade of Shrinking Global Stock Markets Is Finally Over With much of the business world yet to fully recover from the pandemic fallout, the easiness to raise money via equity offerings bodes well for corporate America, according to Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab Corp.

So the firm is now suspending coverage. And you know, Sozzi, we see $211 per share here.

So it really shouldn't be taking too much impact, but there is a lot of news with the company — I imagine it is creating some volatility for sure,"" Wells Fargo auto and mobility analyst Colin Langan said on Yahoo Finance Live.  It's hard to argue the hypothesis.  Tesla shares have plunged 27% since the automaker disclosed on Feb. 8 it had purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin to be held on its balance sheet.  Bitcoin prices have sold off by 16% to $32,000 going back to Tesla's announcement. From the record highs of more than $63,000 hit in mid-April (in part fueled by Tesla's bitcoin appetite), bitcoin has shed nearly 50% as regulators in China crack down on mining in the country. Negative tweets on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining from Tesla CEO Elon Musk haven't helped bitcoin prices, either.  Musk clarified in mid-May that Tesla hadn't sold any of its bitcoin holdings in the face of such concerns. Despite the assurance from crypto influencer Musk, bitcoin prices have continued to trade with a downward bias given global regulatory concerns.  Unless Tesla discloses on its second quarter earnings release in coming weeks it sold off all its bitcoin (thereby breaking the correlation between Tesla's stock and bitcoin), its stock could stay under pressure amid a muted outlook for the crypto's price.  J.P. Morgan strategist and bitcoin expert Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou argued recently that medium-term fair value for bitcoin is in the $24,000 to $36,000 range.

Two months ago, legendary investor Michael Burry, the chief of California-based hedge fund Scion Asset Management, revealed a $530 million short position on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), the most valuable electric car (EV) company in the world. Burry cited increased competition in the EV space as one of the main reasons behind his call. As the stock falls, developments in the market over the past year seem to back Burry.  However, in the past twelve months or so, a flurry of US-based companies working in the electric vehicle sector have gone public through mergers facilitated by special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). These include Fisker Inc. (NYSE: FSR), Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA), and ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CHPT), among others. In addition to other famous EV stocks like NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) and XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV), these firms have done roaring business on the market in the past few months.  This increased activity in the electric vehicle industry has also resulted in investors flocking to EV startups in a bid to identify the next Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). Some of these startups and the SPAC deals they are pursuing are discussed in detail below. Amid the boom, companies that market electric vehicle charging infrastructure and other hardware or software related to EVs have been attracting investor interest, highlighting the shift away from EV makers. Traditional automakers are also stepping up investments in the EV space.  As electric vehicles rise, evidenced by record delivery numbers posted by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and NIO Inc.

Government policies designed to encourage adoption of EVs are also likely to boost EV stocks. This tech-enabled disruption further threatens traditional automakers.

Like VBit's data centers, we're using hydroelectric power.” Following China’s announcement that it would be ramping up its efforts to crack down on the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which sent crypto markets tumbling, some experts believe the cryptocurrency industry may actually benefit greatly in the long run as companies begin to move their mining operations overseas.

Kicking off a two-week trial in Wilmington, Delaware, Musk, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and a slightly askew dark tie, testified that he has tried ""very hard not to be the CEO of Tesla, but I have to or frankly Tesla is going to die.” Board members and others involved in the deal will testify beginning as soon as Tuesday, when Musk will also return to the witness stand. The lawsuit accuses Musk of dominating the board's deal discussions, pushing Tesla to pay more for SolarCity and misleading shareholders about the company's deteriorating financial health. Musk told the court that the Tesla board handled the SolarCity deal and he was not part of the board committee that negotiated the terms. ""I don't even know what happened,"" he testified. Musk responded calmly during cross-examination from shareholder attorney Randall Baron, but Baron's yes or no questions often elicited lengthy, meandering responses. At one point Musk called the lawyer ""a bad human being."" Baron asked if the board vetted his Technoking title, which he gave himself in March. “It generated a whole bunch of free press and Tesla doesn’t advertise and it’s helpful to general sales,” he said. He called the title a joke: “I think I’m funny.” Shares of Tesla closed up about 4.4% on Monday at $685.75. Central to the case are claims that despite his minority stake, Musk was a controlling shareholder of Tesla due to his ties to board members and domineering style. That designation would impose a tougher legal standard and increase",Elon Musk on trial over SolarCity deal: ‘I don’t even know what happened’.,NEGATIVE,0.9966325163841248
TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s aspirations in China were dealt a major blow over the weekend after the government ordered that almost all the cars it’s sold in the nation -- more than 285,000 of them -- be fixed to address a safety issue. The State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on Saturday that the action involves 211,256 locally produced Model 3 vehicles and 35,665 imported ones, as well as 38,599 China-made Model Ys. The California-based carmaker only began deliveries of the Model Y sports-utility vehicle in January, so the recall will affect pretty much every driver who bought one. The Chinese agency said the vehicles’ autopilot systems can be activated automatically, potentially leading to crashes from sudden acceleration. In most cases, the fix should be able to be made remotely with an online update to the cars’ active cruise control feature. Tesla will upgrade the software for free. While Tesla apologized via its official customer support account on Weibo, saying that it will “continue to improve safety in strict accordance with national requirements,” the recall tops a string of embarrassing setbacks for the company in China. A protest that went viral at the Shanghai auto show in mid-April and a spate of crashes has soured public opinion toward the EV pioneer and a few local governments and official institutions are reviewing Tesla ownership among their staff, citing concerns the cars pose security risks.

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s biggest money managers say the strong rally in China’s renewable energy stocks has more legs, citing the sector’s rosy earnings prospects and policy support. BlackRock Inc., Aberdeen Standard Investments Ltd. and UBS Global Wealth Management are among those backing investments in Chinese electric vehicle-related companies and solar firms. Their endorsement comes as the world’s largest battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. and major solar producer LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. hit record highs this week after surging more than 40% each in the last quarter. Global funds are upbeat because of China’s continued dominance in global EV battery and solar panel production, and the nation’s supportive industry policies serving its ambitious goal of reaching carbon neutrality in 2060. International expansion by key players is among other reasons for their optimism. Chinese companies are increasingly threatening the EV market share of Tesla Inc., which has captivated much of the investment world’s imagination until recently. Tesla slid nearly 4% during the first half of the year even as other automakers surged ahead. “It’s a structural, long-term growth story that investors are prepared to pay up for today,” said James Thom, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard. “The anticipated uplift in renewable energy capacity over the next five years under the latest ‘five-year plan’ is sufficient to justify current valuations,” he added, referring to Beijing’s blueprint for economic and social development through 2025.

TSLA," (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's vehicle registrations in California rose more than 85% in the second quarter versus last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from Cross-Sell https://info.cross-sell.com/tesla-special-report-0, a research firm that collates title and registration data. The automaker posted record vehicle deliveries for the April-to-June quarter earlier this month, as it dealt with a semiconductor shortage and relied on sales of its cheaper models. California registrations for the Model Y, Tesla's electric crossover utility vehicle, jumped more than sevenfold to 13,581, Cross-Sell data showed on Thursday. The focus is now on the company's second-quarter earnings report due on July 26, with investors waiting to gauge if bitcoin's recent fall would hit Tesla's bottom line, due to its exposure to the cryptocurrency's volatility. Total second-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected stood at 46,926, with Model Y accounting for more than half of the registrations. California, a bellwether for the electric-car maker, accounted for about half of the vehicle registrations in these states with a total of 23,556 registrations, Cross-Sell data showed. Tesla has been increasing prices for its vehicles in recent months, with billionaire boss Elon Musk in May blaming the rise on ""major supply chain price pressure"", especially raw materials. Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.

Burry is one of the most renowned names in the hedge fund industry, managing over $1.3 billion in assets, and has previously voiced skepticism over the market capitalization of the EV maker and warned Musk about increasing competition in the EV space from traditional carmakers. Burry jumped to prominence during the 2008 financial crisis after he bet $1 billion against the US housing bubble that ultimately crashed and resulted in one of the worst financial meltdowns of the post-war era around the world. Over the past decade, Burry has focused on investments related to water, gold, and farm lands, while also investing periodically in high growth stocks like Alphabet Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis on the EV industry, its history, current status, and future outlook, you can go ahead to the 5 Best EV Stocks to Invest In. In 2008, when Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) released its first car, perhaps no one had fully realized how popular electric vehicles (EVs) would become just over a decade later. The market for EVs has managed to become one that has seen exponential growth in the past couple of years and will foreseeably grow even more in the years to come. For instance, in 2019, EV sales crossed the 2.1 million mark globally, which surpassed the sales in 2018, according to the International Energy Agency. Keeping up with this consistent trend, it is foreseen by Markets and Markets that the market size of EVs will still continue to grow from 4,093 thousand units this year to 34,756 thousand units by 2030, representing a CAGR of 26.8%. Perhaps one of the major reasons for the sudden and continued popularity of EVs rests in the fact that traditional cars, and the fuel they consume, are incredibly harmful to the environment. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's Green Vehicle Guide, normal cars tend to emit roughly 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide in a year. The figure is, of course, dependent on the car type, the fuel it consumes, fuel economy, and mileage. However, the basic idea remains the same: traditional cars emit a range of greenhouse gases that are woefully harmful to the environment by contributing to growing temperatures and global warming. Apart from just carbon dioxide, normal cars also emit methane and nitrous oxide from the tailpipe and hydrofluorocarbon emissions from air conditioners. All these gases also have a higher global warming potential (GWP) than carbon dioxide. In contrast, your typical EV tends to be a blessing for the environment. According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EVs have the potential to reduce the emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, and broaden the scope of fuel choices available to US citizens, while ensuring the country does not become vulnerable to price hikes and disruptions in the supply of petroleum. The first claim is possible since the electricity needed to charge an EV can, and very often does, come from renewable sources, like solar or","Tesla, Nissan, BMW among top 5 best EV stocks to invest in.",POSITIVE,0.9994775652885437

The survey showed that 25% of respondents believe Tesla share values will rise before the end of 2021 to a price close to the January highs, and 17% anticipate a finish to the year that exceeds the stock’s previous peak. Investors’ prognosis is more optimistic in the long run, with 30% saying the stock price will land between $1,000 and $2,000 two years from now, 17% projecting an $800-1,000 value and 11% expecting a value of $2,000-$3,000. “The insane run-up in the price of the stock over the last decade is, like all investments, a bet on the future,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. “As such, it helps to be comfortable with roller coasters if you want to buy Tesla stock. That’s because volatile price swings have become a hallmark of the stock’s performance over the years.” The survey reveals the influence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with over 60% of investors believing him to be the most influential personality around when it comes to financial markets. A minority of respondents, yet still a striking 33%, agreed that Musk has built up Tesla stock’s price based on “fantasy” as opposed to “revolutionary vision.” Perhaps more telling, however, was that almost 60% of Tesla investors are more loyal to the CEO than to the company itself. “As one of the leading innovators in the auto industry, Tesla has generated a lot of interest from retail traders in recent years,” Cohen said. “It has developed a loyal cult-like following from fans and enthusiasts who believe in the company’s technology and often laud Musk with praise, devotion and admiration.” “However, at the same time, the company has many vociferous critics who argue the electric vehicle pioneer could go bankrupt in the years ahead due to its soaring debt and high cash burn.” Delving into Musk’s recent influence within the cryptocurrency space, the poll asked respondents if the Tesla chief’s manipulation of cryptocurrency values has changed their view of that investment. 51% agreed that Musk “has too much power” and 40% said that cryptocurrencies in general “are too volatile.” 24% don’t believe Musk has too much influence over cryptocurrencies, while only",Investing.com survey finds investors more loyal to Musk.

TSLA,"NIO Inc. (NIO) designs and manufactures high-tech electric vehicles in China. As a major player and innovator in connectivity, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence technologies, it competes directly with Tesla (TSLA). The main value for NIO comes from its competitive positioning in the luxury electric vehicle market (especially SUVs) in China, stemming from its comparable technology combined with its cheaper price point. Furthermore, as a leading local manufacturer and innovator in high-priority cutting edge technology fields, the Chinese government has a vested interest in NIO’s continued growth and success. This should not only lead to continued financial support through difficult times, but may also lead to the government-controlled media stirring up popular opinion against its main competitors, as it has done with TSLA recently. (See Nio stock chart on TipRanks) The company is expected to continue generating strong growth on the back of the re-opening of the global economy following the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the continued robust growth of the Chinese middle class. Moreover, as its advanced automotive technologies continue to emerge and take a greater share of the overall global automobile market, demand for its products and technologies should grow. That said, the company also has numerous challenges with which to contend. First and foremost, it already faces significant competition from larger companies, such as TSLA, that possess powerful innovative capabilities and strong brand images. Additionally, as a Chinese company, it faces significant political risk (as Alibaba (BABA) recently learned the hard way), accounting risk, and execution risk. The latter risk is due to the fact that it is still a smaller scale business that has to deliver on aggressive growth expectations. Valuation Metrics Despite these challenges, NIO still possesses a strong position in the space, giving it a significant edge to leverage in terms of industry-specific consumer data and network. However, its valuation remains elevated. The forward price to cash flow is a whopping 95.6x, and the company is not profitable yet on a GAAP basis, while simultaneously bleeding cash. The good news is that revenue is expected to triple over the next two years and the business should finally be profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2022, though the EBITDA margin will still likely be razor thin at just 2.3%.

In an extensive dive into the EV industry's outlook, UBS voiced several noteworthy concerns for the diehard Tesla bulls.  ""While results from our EV survey are solid across the board for Tesla, momentum in the quarters ahead is likely more in favor of competitors with a busier launch pipeline. Our key concern shorter-term is that Tesla's demand momentum in China is slowing, and our checks on the ground suggest that BEVs [battery electric vehicles] from domestic brands are gaining further ground vs. Tesla, which may trigger additional pricing action by Tesla and consequently lower gross margins,"" explained UBS. ""Further, the delays in Model Y launch in Europe, FSD [full self-driving] rollout and the next-gen 4680 battery in Fremont (we think this is the root cause for the cancellation of Model S Plaid+) will weigh on sentiment for Tesla.""  Tesla's stock fell by more than 1% in early afternoon trading Tuesday.  Add souring Wall Street sentiment on Tesla's competitive position as the latest factor weighing on the stock price.  Tesla shares have plunged 22% since the automaker disclosed on Feb. 8 it had purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin to be held on its balance sheet. The pullback coincides with the latest crypto winter, which has seen prices for bitcoin nosedive to $35,000 from a record high of $63,000 in mid-April.  Meanwhile, Tesla's ""soft recall"" of 285,000 cars in China this week due to cruise control safety concerns hasn't been well received by market goers. The EV pioneer had already been dealing with consumer complaints in China over product quality.  The unwelcome developments have sparked concern on Tesla potentially losing market share to China-based EV rivals such as Nio and Xpeng. Tesla's stock has shed 24% since reaching an intraday high of $895 on Jan. 26, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data.  That said, the folks at UBS had one final parting gift for Musk in their assessment.  ""Fundamentally, we argued in our deep-dive report that ~$400 billion market value could be justified by the software complex —",Analysts cut EPS estimates by 11% and 10% for 2021 and 2022.,NEGATIVE,0.993100106716156

Last Friday shares of Churchill Capital Corp IV (CCIV) popped higher as Lucid announced it will close its reverse merger with the blank check company on July 23, following a shareholder vote on the 22nd. This was welcome news for the stock as it had been down over 50% since hitting an all-time high in mid February. Prior to that bit of news, Lucid passed a big sales milestone for its Air electric sedan— just as the factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, was starting to come online. ""Our [Air] reservations have just exceeded 10,000,"" Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson said during an interview with Yahoo Finance, from Lucid’s just opened New York City studio. ""They are bona fide reservations with appropriate deposits. Some people have even paid over a $7,000 deposit.” In addition to collecting the deposits, the company is plowing that cash into new investments, pulling forward some planned capital expenditures that Rawlinson said were necessary to increase capacity and enhance manufacturing capabilities. An investment of note would be the second production line that would be soon installed for Project Gravity, the forthcoming SUV from Lucid. These capital investments were necessary as preproduction and quality validation builds were happening now on the factory floor for Lucid’s Air sedan. Rawlinson reiterated that the builds were progressing smoothly, with some small hiccups along the way, but that initial deliveries to customers would still occur in the back half of 2021. I had the chance to ride in one of those preproduction Lucid Air sedan around the streets of Lower Manhattan and the West Side Highway. The Air I rode was pretty much a near production model, save for a couple body panels that spanned the pillars and roof of the car. Fit and finish were quite good for a pre-production build, the ""stellar white"" paint looked smooth, and panel gap lines were pretty consistent. The dual motor Grand Touring edition here packed around 1,000 horsepower, so our jaunt around town was brisk, but incredibly smooth and quiet as well — which is fairly normal for electric sedans.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its share price skyrocket by over 600% last year...with the EV giant surging past some of the United States’ most influential companies, including Visa, JP Morgan, and Walmart. Its market capitalization is now sitting at just over half of a trillion dollars… And its success has paved the way for the entire industry, as well.

That’s why we’ve put together a list of some of our favorite EV industry plays that we think are still flying under the radar. #1 Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Blink Charging was trading at just over $1.50 last May… But the run-up in electric vehicle stocks has sent this infrastructure play soaring. In just a year, Blink has seen its share price skyrocket by an astounding 1996%...but this could be just the beginning. Investors are betting big on the future. It’s an “if you build it, they will come” stock story, and it’s still in its first act. Blink is building an electric vehicle charging network, and it has explosive potential.

Cryptocurrencies have exploded in value over the past few years as a younger generation of internet enthusiasts, who are wary of big finance and eager to exploit the potential of a globally-connected digital network, devote their energies to the development and marketing of new crypto products and offerings. However, Bitcoin, the most popular crypto coin, and Ethereum, the second largest coin in terms of market capitalization, still maintain a stranglehold over the crypto world, accounting for close to $1 trillion and $400 billion in value respectively. Companies eager to ride the crypto boom, like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) have poured billions into making the new technology mainstream so that they can profit off the process. However, in recent weeks, these firms have been experiencing the price volatility often associated with crypto stocks but have so far continued to underline their bullish outlook on the crypto industry for the long-term. Hedge funds have also been piling into crypto-related investments in the past few months.  The influx of institutional investors is a very welcoming sign for an industry that many claim is still in its infancy. Naturally, there is also some resistance to the adoption of the new technology, as crypto is often called a disruptor in the finance world that will one day upend the entire system. However, these polarizing points of view exist side by side and no one has thus far been able to dominate the narrative around digital currencies in general single handedly. A growing US-China cold war over crypto, though, is a major concern among crypto enthusiasts.  Even as a Chinese crackdown against crypto firms intensifies, crypto startups and crypto-linked IPOs have been generating a lot of buzz in investor circles in the United States.

Despite the fact that the coin had rallied at the end of June, with prices rising from close to $30,000 on the weekend to above $35,000 on Wednesday, it had its worst quarter since the bear market of 2018, and its third-worst quarter since 2014, in terms of US dollar performance.

But thanks to fierce environmental resistance, red tape and planning tweaks it is completely unclear when the first vehicles will roll off the production line of the electric carmaker's first European factory. Tesla has already pushed back the expected opening to late 2021. Yet the environmental agency in Brandenburg, the state where the 5.8 billion euro ($6.9 billion) plant is being built, has still not given final approval - meaning a further delay cannot be ruled out, even into 2022. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? It's complicated. Tesla and its billionaire boss Elon Musk unveiled plans in late 2019 to build the factory. However the site partly overlaps a drinking water protection zone and borders on a nature reserve, which has drawn heavy opposition from local residents and environmental groups. Last year, Tesla had to suspend clearing of a forest at the site after environmentalists from local group Nabu highlighted the risk posed to a rare local snake species whose winter slumber could be disturbed by tree-cutting activity. The snakes had to be rescued before Tesla could proceed but there have been numerous other efforts to stop work at the site on environmental grounds. ""Thousands of hectares of forest will be cleared to create the needed infrastructure and housing space,"" said Manuela Hoyer, who lives about 9 km from the site and is a member of a local campaign opposed to it. ""To build such a plant in a protected drinking water area is actually a crime against the environment."" Her comments reflects a broader trend in Germany that has also seen renewable projects, such as wind farms, coming under fire from residents that fear the impact on the local habitat.

Subscribe Friday, June 18, 2021 We're less than a week out from the halfway point of 2021.  And one of the big real economy stories this year has been the explosion in demand for cars. This has pushed up prices, particularly for used cars.  And while most used cars, and those on the road today, are running on internal combustion engines (ICE), the industry agrees that electric vehicles (EVs) are the future. For the last decade, the best way to play that trend has been via Tesla (TSLA). Shareholders in that particular trade have been rewarded handsomely: since June 2011, the car maker's shares are up over 10,000%.  This year, however, investors have been betting that the industry's old guard can make their businesses work better in an electrified future.  Through Thursday's close, shares of Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) were both up more than 40%, outpacing both the broader market and all of the market's buzziest names in the EV space.  At an industry conference on Thursday, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's second quarter earnings were likely to come in better than expected. Earlier this week, GM announced that it would increase its investment in electric vehicles to $35 billion from $27 billion through 2025.  And it was only a few weeks back that Ford announced its own ambitious plans to electrify more of its fleet, unveiling an electric F-150, its best-selling ICE vehicle, while unveiling plans to invest $30 billion in electric vehicle development over the next five years. This year's rally in shares of GM and Ford also remind us (in yet another way) how different this recovery has been from what we endured after the financial crisis.  GM and Chrysler went bankrupt during the 2008-09 recession; Ford just barely staved off that fate. This time around, these companies are parlaying a surge in consumer demand into increased investments in trying to keep up with the Teslas of the world.  These announcements out of Ford and GM also come as upstart competitors like Nikola (NKLA) and Lordstown Motors (RIDE) struggle to accurately communicate with investors.

TSLA,"Regulators in China taking a tougher stance on cryptocurrencies could partially explain the most recent rout in bitcoin prices. But some Wall Street watchers think the U.S. Federal Reserve's new hawkish stance on interest rate policy and bond buying is also playing a key role.  ""It is our belief that part of the momentous rally (an important part) has been helped by the Fed’s largess. Bitcoin and other cryptos should rally further on their own over the years, but we believe that they have been pulled forward by the Fed’s stimulus. In other words, we do not think that the stock market is the only asset class that has gotten ahead of itself due to the massive stimulus programs of the past year plus,"" said Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley in a new research note.  Bitcoin prices have nosedived by 16% to $32,000 since the Fed surprised investors on June 16 by signaling two potential interest rate increases by the end of 2023. Many market watchers surmised the Fed was trying to talk down red-hot asset prices (which have in part been fueled by the ability to borrow money cheaply), and bitcoin is no exception.  Bitcoin prices fell below the key $30,000 level on Tuesday, touching $29,458 at the lows as traders continued to digest Fed day and hawkish comments since from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.  From the record highs of more than $63,000 hit in mid-April, bitcoin has shed nearly 50% as regulators in China crack down on mining in the country. Negative tweets on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining from Tesla CEO Elon Musk haven't helped bitcoin prices, either. Now that bitcoin prices have breached the important support point of $30,000, traders are bracing for an additional selling wave in the near-term.  Warns Maley, ""Bitcoin has touched that $30,000 level (or at least come very close to it) several times over the last month. Therefore, if it drops below that level in any meaningful way, it’s going to be very bearish on a technical basis. Thus the $20,000 level that many pundits have been pointing to recently is not out of the question at all.

TSLA,"Check back at 8:30 a.m. ET for the results Tesla shares gained upside momentum and moved above the $650 level after the company announced that it had opened a solar-powered charging station in Tibet. The station in Tibet is the first such facility in China, and it includes an on-site power storage. This moved reminded investors that Tesla has a solar business which may serve as an additional source of growth in the future. At this point, solar business, which Tesla acquired with the purchase of SolarCity back in 2016, gets much less attention than the company’s car business, but the situation may change if Tesla finds a way to grow it at a robust pace. While the new charging station in Tibet may prove to be an important milestone for the company, it looks that the current upside move is fueled by general market optimism. Powell’s recent comments were dovish as usual, the yields of 10-year Treasuries have settled below 1.50% while S&P 500 is trading near historic highs. In this environment, Tesla has the opportunity to attract additional investor attention as it trades more than 25% below highs that were reached at the beginning of this year. Meanwhile, analysts estimates for Tesla have remained stable in recent weeks. Currently, analysts expect that Tesla will report earnings of $4.53 per share in 2021. In 2022, the company’s earnings are projected to grow to $6.22 per share, so Tesla is trading at 105 forward P/E. This valuation implies huge growth in the upcoming years which often makes a stock very sensitive to various news. In Tesla’s case, the market is already accustomed to sky-high valuation, so the near-term dynamics of its stock will mostly depend on general market sentiment towards tech stocks while traders wait for the second-quarter earnings season.

On Saturday, the EV pioneer began the recall of over 285,000 vehicles in China, due to a safety risk regarding a cruise control feature. According to China's State Administration for Market Regulation, the Tesla autopilot system can automatically turn on when drivers attempt to shift gears or touch the gear selector by mistake, resulting in accidental acceleration, which could potentially lead to crashes. The recall covers roughly 211,000 locally made Model 3 vehicles and 36,000 imported ones, and an additional 38,000 Model Ys – amounting to almost all of Tesla’s Chinese deliveries in recent years. The vehicles themselves will not be returned, as the recall will be done remotely via an online software update or the software will be delivered in-person. This a “moment of truth for Tesla,” says Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Over the last year, the company has fought against the negative PR issues concerning autopilot in China, and the latest gaffe is a “clear ‘black eye moment’ for Musk & Co. in this key region.” With the negative PR issues pling up in a market which by next year is poised to make up 40% of global deliveries, this is clearly not the news the bulls were hoping for. “That said,” the 5-star analyst goes on to say, “Now it’s about Musk & Co. making sure these issues are in the rear view mirror, correcting software/autopilot problems, and moving forward to make sure this situation is not a defining negative chapter in the Tesla China story.” While Ives believes the situation is tantamount to a “bump in the road,” the analyst says Tesla needs to sort out the autopilot safety issues once and for all, for this “PR black cloud” to eventually fade into the distance. Overall, however, there’s no change to Ives’ bullish stance; the analyst rates TSLA shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $1,000 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of a hefty 49%. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here) So, that’s the Wedbush view. What does the rest of the Street have in mind for TSLA?

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Jeff Bezos is leaving the rest of the world behind when it comes to wealth accumulation. The world’s richest man reached a record $211 billion net worth Tuesday after Amazon.com Inc. shares rose 4.7% after the Pentagon announced it was canceling a cloud-computing contract with rival Microsoft Corp. The rally raised Bezos’s fortune by $8.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The last time anyone in the Bloomberg ranking neared this amount was in January, when Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk briefly hit $210 billion. The two men spent the first part of the year trading the top spot as the world’s richest person, but Bezos has cemented his hold on No. 1 since mid-March as Amazon shares climbed almost 20% during that time. Soaring stock prices in recent months have boosted the fortunes of a group of tech titans including Musk. He remains in second place behind Bezos with a $180.8 billion net worth even as Tesla shares fell Tuesday. French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault is third at $168.5 billion. Bezos’s record haul is even greater than during a 2020 Amazon stock surge, when his net worth topped out at $206.9 billion as the pandemic turbocharged the company’s price. Bezos, 57, officially stepped down as Amazon’s chief executive officer this week after a 27-year run. He still owns about 11% of the company and serves as the firm’s executive chairman. The Pentagon said Tuesday it was scrapping a $10 billion cloud-computing contract awarded in 2019 to Microsoft Corp. after several years of wrangling between the government and some of the biggest U.S. tech companies over the deal. The decision indicates it planned to split the work between Microsoft and rival Amazon.

TSLA," Ford F recently announced its decision to discontinue the use of the turbodiesel Power Stroke V-6 engine option in the Ford F-150 pickup trucks.The Power Stroke engine was first integrated into the previous-generation F-150 in 2018 and was being used unmodified in the new truck for 2021. The decision to drop this engine was triggered by the overwhelming customer response for the EcoBoost V-6 gasoline engines.Ford’s decision to halt the run of the Power Stroke 3.0-liter engine does not come as a major surprise. The engine only produced 250 horsepower, making it the least powerful engine in the line-up. Moreover, it was easily surpassed by the 290-hp 3.3-liter V-6 and the 325-hp EcoBoost 2.7-liter V-6 engines.The only charm offered by the Power Stroke is its 440 pound-feet of torque, making it an attractive option for those who want to tow. Nonetheless, customers who want maximum towing torque should opt for the PowerBoost engine, which offers a number of advantages over the Power Stroke engine but was unavailable when the diesel engine was first introduced. With its 3.5-liter V-6 hybrid setup producing 430 hp and 570 pound-feet of torque, the PowerBoost is the ideal combination of capability and power. Moreover, Ford has priced the hybrid slightly below the diesel option, making it more appealing for customers.Another attraction point for the hybrid variant is its fuel economy. The diesel engine was initially the first choice for those who wanted a fuel-powered F-150, since its EPA combined rating of 24 mpg was the highest amid all 2020 truck variants. However, for 2021, the diesel’s rating fell by 1 mpg, while the new PowerBoost hybrid has an EPA rating of 24 mpg combined, making it the new fuel efficient leader in the F-150 truck fleet.The Power Stroke 3.0-liter V-6 engine choice can be ordered until Jul 16, with deliveries occurring throughout the year.In May, Ford unveiled a version of the F-150 Lightning pickup truck — the all-new 2022 F-150 Lightning Pro  — the first-ever all-electric F-Series truck designed for commercial customers.F-150 Lightning Pro will be built at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn and hit the roads next year.

TSLA," Chicago, IL – July 14, 2021 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of Tesla, Inc. TSLA as the Bull of the Day, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. CALM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Energy Transfer LP ET, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. MMP and Plains GP Holdings, L.P. PAGP. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Tesla is a Zacks  Rank #2 (Buy) and it has been leading a lot of the solar stocks higher. Sure, there is an automobile component to the company as well as having top notch leadership, but of late solar stocks have been pushing higher. Let's take a deeper look at this stock in this Bull of the Day article. Tesla, Inc. makes and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally. The company was formerly known as Tesla Motors, Inc. and changed its name to Tesla, Inc. in February 2017. Tesla, Inc. was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California The first thing I do when I look at stock is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has been able to communicate to the market. A stock that consistently beats is one that has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see. For TSLA, I see a great history of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. There are three beats over the last four quarters.  The average positive earnings surprise over the last fours quarters works out to be 147%, which means that they are posting results that are more than what is expected.  There was a monster beat four quarters ago (544%) and that skewed the average up quite a bit. Still, the company beats and that helps boost estimates higher and higher. The Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher. For TSLA, I see estimates moving higher. Over the last 60 days I am seeing several increases. This quarter has moved from 89 cents to $0.90. Next quarter has held still at $1.10. The full year number has increased from $4.25 to $4.30 over the last 60 days. Next year is at $6.27 and that is up from $6.26 over",Tesla is a Rank #2 (Buy) and it has been leading a lot of solar stocks higher.,POSITIVE,0.9975088238716125

TSLA,"The company Tesla (TSLA) booted from the S&P 500 index has vastly outperformed the electric automaker by a “stupendous margin,” analysts at Research Affiliates pointed out this week. Tesla entered the S&P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe. Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&P 500 does not become the S&P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot. According to analysis from Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott, Vitali Kalesnik, and Lillian Wu, Apartment Investment and Management, this pattern is not uncommon. Frequently, additions to the index underperform and removed companies often do very well, the authors wrote in a research note. ""Traditional cap-weighted indices routinely buy high and sell low when the index rebalances resulting in substantial hidden costs to investors who track the index,” the note said. “The December 2020 S&P 500 rebalance out of AIV and into TSLA cost investors 41 [basis points] in the first six months, and the cost may go higher.” In their view, a struggling stock getting kicked out of the index during a rebalancing means getting the axe at a low point. On the other side, a hot new stock getting added to the index is trading at a high point. The authors pointed out that though index investing is passive, the actual indexes aren’t necessarily passive as the decisions on which companies to include in the S&P 500 is controlled by a committee. And the index changes to compensate for companies’ valuations and new entrants periodically, not automatically. An investor who had $100,000 in, say, an S&P 500 index fund on Dec. 21 when the rebalancing happened would be $410 poorer had no rebalance happened, Research Affiliates calculated. ""Unfortunately, this cost is totally unnoticed by investors because it is baked into the index’s performance,” the authors wrote. The analysis suggests these are hidden costs of indexing and Tesla’s underperformance and Apartment",Analysts say indexing costs investors ‘substantial hidden costs’.

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, the powers that be on Wall Street have toyed with questions about whether it would be feasible to move the stock market onto a blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.The innovators in the fast-moving world of decentralized finance -- or DeFi -- aren’t waiting around to see how those discussions unfold. Instead, they’ve built synthetic versions of equities that track some of the world’s biggest companies. In essence, the anti-establishment ethos of the crypto world is being applied to a rough facsimile of the stock market.Fake versions of Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and other big stocks, as well as a few popular exchange-traded funds, have been created by the projects Mirror Protocol and Synthetix over the past year. The tokens, and the programming that allows them to trade, are engineered to reflect the prices of the securities they track without any actual purchases or sales of the real stocks and ETFs involved. So far, volumes are just a tiny fraction of those on regulated exchanges. But for crypto enthusiasts, the potential upside is huge.The synthetic shares join a strange new world of assets such as digital artwork and highlights of NBA games now trading on blockchains. Yet, unlike the modern art and dunks of the non-fungible token universe, these instruments raise questions about how they fit into a global stock market and brokerage industry governed by thousands of pages of rules from dozens of countries. At the moment, it’s a case of innovation that’s way ahead of regulation. Which is exactly how Do Kwon likes it. The co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, the South Korean company that created the Mirror Protocol on its Terra blockchain, Kwon fancies himself as a sort of modern-day Robin Hood of finance -- in the mode of Vlad Tenev or Chamath Palihapitiya. DeFi “is so powerful in unlocking financial services for disenfranchised people around the world,” he said via email, that “it’s better to move fast and break things. Waiting for fragmented regulatory frameworks to crystallize before innovating is counterintuitive.” Synthetic Assets For Kwon and other proponents of these new synthetic assets, avoiding the various rules and barriers of the financial world is a feature, not a bug.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Reddit's WallStreetBets Meme Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into. Users on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, a group with over 10.5 million members, have been one of the most influential forces in the market over the past six months. The forum is home to many retail investors who use the internet platform to spoil short-selling attempts by hedge funds, often sending the share prices of stocks with weak business fundamentals soaring. These stocks, dubbed meme stocks, have resulted in losses worth billions to hedge funds. These funds now track Reddit forums to shield themselves from meme stock rallies.  In addition to meme stocks, some of which are discussed below in detail, there are some other, perhaps safer, stock options that are popular on the forum as well. These include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP), among others. However, these usually go unnoticed in the chaos surrounding meme stocks. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Melvin Capital Management, one of the most well-known hedge funds on Wall Street, lost $6 billion to meme stocks at the beginning of this year and is still down close to 50% year-to-date.  The number represents just a fraction of the total losses that hedge funds have incurred as a result of the Reddit meme stocks this year. The ten biggest hedge fund casualties of the Reddit short squeeze can be accessed here. However, even as the meme stocks single out losers, they have also produced winners. According to a report published by business news publication Bloomberg, Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin made more than $675 million from a meme stock rally, spurred by users on WallStreetBets forum, earlier this year.  It remains to be seen whether retail investors can sustain the momentum they have gained in the battle for market supremacy as inflation threatens interest in volatile growth stocks and hedge funds, keen to respond in kind after being scapegoated as the villains of the finance world, try to assert their dominance.

TSLA,"Tesla will recall nearly 300,000 Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles delivered in China. According to Bloomberg and Nikkei Asia, the country's State Administration for Market Regulation has announced the automaker's decision on its website. While the move is being called a ""recall,"" owners aren't required to bring in their cars. Since it's meant to address risks associated with the vehicles' assisted driving feature, Tesla will be able to rectify the problem by rolling out an online software update to upgrade the company's Autopilot system. Bloomberg says the recall is the result of an investigation the regulator conducted to look into product defects. Apparently, the affected vehicles' Autopilot feature is too easily activated while driving, which means it could lead to accidents.  The recall includes 211,256 Model 3 vehicles made in China between December 19th, 2019 and June 7th 2021, as well as 35,665 imported Model 3s manufactured in 2019. A total of 38,599 Model Ys are also included, all made in China from the beginning of this year until June 7th. As the publication notes, Tesla delivered 275,000 imported and locally made Model 3s and Model Ys in China since 2019, so the recall covers almost all the cars it officially shipped in the country.  Tesla delivered its first vehicles made at Shanghai's Gigafactory 3 plant in December 2019. Shortly after that, the automaker was reportedly forced to equip its Model 3 vehicles with its old Hardware 2.5 instead of its newer Hardware 3.0 silicon due to the global chip shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s largest individual shareholders Jack Ma and Joe Tsai pledged parts of their combined $35 billion stake in the e-commerce giant in exchange for significant loans from banks, the Financial Times reported, citing company documents. The share pledges were made by offshore companies controlling more than half of the duo’s stake in Alibaba, which stood at 5.8% as of December, according to the FT. The documents didn’t disclose the amount of the share pledges, which began when Alibaba listed in the U.S. in 2014. Ma and Tsai have a net worth of about $50 billion and $13 billion, respectively, with most of their wealth derived from their holdings in the e-commerce giant, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The transactions allowed the two to access cash without selling stock -- a common technique for company founders and the ultra-wealthy. Elon Musk has used stock in Tesla Inc. to obtain personal loans, Larry Ellison has put up millions of Oracle Corp. shares to fund his lifestyle, while SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son uses a web of global banks to borrow against his holdings. Borrowing against the value of shares, as compared to selling them, offers tax advantages in the U.S. since only realized gains are subject to taxation. It also allows a founder to keep betting on their own company’s appreciation. Still, there are risks. Some wealthy investors had to meet margin calls on pledged shares when markets plunged in the early days of the pandemic. Ma and Tsai pledged their shares to banks including UBS Group AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the newspaper reported. Tsai’s Gulfstream 650ER private jet is mortgaged to Credit Suisse, and the Swiss bank also extended financing to a firm later connected to Ma buying a luxury home in Hong Kong. Alibaba told the FT that co-founder Ma and his affiliates currently didn’t have any loans outstanding collateralized by the company’s shares. In Vice Chairman Tsai’s case, his outstanding loans backed by shares were easily manageable, with prudent loan-to-value ratios to provide a substantial cushion against triggering a margin call, the report cited Alibaba as saying.

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Few companies have been as polarizing on Wall Street as Tesla Inc. -- and the lackluster run that’s weighed on the S&P 500 Index this year has done nothing to lessen it. To Piper Sandler & Co.’s Alexander Potter, the company’s potential dominance of the electric-car business warrants a $1,200 stock-price target, nearly double its $679.70 close on Wednesday. To Craig Irwin of Roth Capital Partners, as rivals move to pick off a head start that turned Tesla into the world’s most highly valued car company, the stock will sink to $150. The divergence illustrates the tension that sent Tesla shares down nearly 4% during the first half of the year even as other automakers surged ahead. That’s a marked contrast to its more than 8-fold jump last year and reflects investors’ doubts about heady growth expectations for the company in the face of stronger competitive threats and signs of a sales slowdown in China. “For a long time Tesla was the only credible player in the high-quality EV market, and we are seeing that starting to change,” said JoAnne Feeney, portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, who said the company’s current valuation assumes it will become the biggest seller of cars in the U.S. “That seems to be an awful lot to ask.” Read more: Rob Arnott Says He Told You Tesla Would Be a Drag on the S&P 500 Tesla sold about half a million cars worldwide in 2020, accounting for a fraction of even the 14.5 million light vehicles sold in the U.S., and it’s facing threats from traditional automakers such as General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG that are launching their own electric-vehicle lineups. In China, Tesla’s lead over other startups has already started to shrink, according to UBS Group AG analyst Patrick Hummel. That competition poses a separate challenge to the company’s bottom line: Tesla has profited from selling carbon-offset credits to other carmakers that haven’t met their emissions targets. But the more its rivals’ sales of electric vehicles take off, the more that source of revenue will drop. Yet Tesla’s stock-market valuation is based on the expectation of steep growth, giving it little room for error.

TSLA,"June 23 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will list SpaceX's space internet venture, Starlink, when its cash flow is reasonably predictable, the billionaire entrepreneur said late on Wednesday. ""Going public sooner than that would be very painful,"" Musk said in a tweet. ""Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference."" He was responding to a question on Twitter, where a user asked: ""Any thoughts on Starlink IPO we would love to invest in the future. Any thoughts on first dibs for Tesla retail investors?"" Last year, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell floated the idea of spinning off Starlink for an initial public offering. Starlink, a planned network of tens of thousands of satellites in low-earth orbit, aims to offer fast internet speeds globally. Musk had said earlier that Starlink, currently based in Redmond, Washington, will be a crucial source of funding for his broader plans like developing the Starship rocket to fly paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars.

TSLA," In this article, we discuss the 10 popular penny stocks on Robinhood. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Popular Penny Stocks on Robinhood. Robinhood, the popular stock trading application with millions of users, has taken the market by storm over the past couple of years, becoming the platform of choice for retail investors keen to invest in penny stocks that have significant upside potential. Despite controversy surrounding the decisions of the firm in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga earlier this year, the platform continues to grow. In the first quarter of 2021, the user base of the application grew 151% year-on-year to 18 million. The revenue over the period registered a 309% Y/Y increase. Robinhood users have an average age of around 30 and prefer to invest in growth stocks Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), among others. However, biopharma firm Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has also been among some of the most popular stocks on the platform in the wake of the coronavirus crises. Despite the dominance of these pricey offerings, there are several penny stocks that Robinhood traders have shown active interest in over the past few weeks. Some of these stocks are listed and discussed below in detail.  Robinhood has made the stock market more accessible to people from all kinds of different ages and backgrounds, resulting in an influx of retail investor interest in equities that has shattered all records. The organic growth of the platform has been impressive. The firm claims that nearly 80% of users on the application sign up through referrals or on their own, a unique feat in a world dominated by advertising metrics. The company is planning to go public soon and is valued at over $40 billion, making it one of the most lucrative American startups.  However, Robinhood will have to navigate regulatory crackdowns, a dramatic lull in the prices of crypto stocks, and inflation fears leading to decreased retail investor interest in stocks as it tries to keep the growth momentum going in the second half of the year.

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares formed a trading pattern Friday that is closely watched by traders as it often precedes further losses for the stock. The short-term average price for the stock fell below the long-term average, forming a so-called death cross. Shares of the electric vehicle maker have been on a rough ride already this year, falling 8%, even as the broader market rose nearly 16%. The decline reflects growing investor concern about competition from traditional carmakers that are pushing aggressively into the EV race, as well as the company’s future growth trajectory in China, which is among the world’s biggest markets for automobiles. On Thursday, Tesla unveiled a significantly cheaper version of its Model Y car in the country, even as its China deliveries dropped last month. The last time Tesla shares formed this trading pattern was in February 2019, and it preceded a more than 40% decline in the share price within 65 days, to $35.79 from $63.98. Tesla shares dropped as much as 1.2% on Friday in New York. Shares of smaller EV startups also languished, with Workhorse Group Inc. and XPeng Inc. among the biggest decliners in the group.

TSLA," (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s shares have become less correlated with those of large U.S. technology companies ahead of the electric-vehicle maker’s earnings report and Bitcoin may be the reason why. The 20-day correlation between Tesla’s stock price and the Nasdaq 100 index has fallen from 0.83 on June 17 to 0.14 as of Wednesday. A decline can also be found in the relationship between the EV company’s shares and the NYSE FANG+ index, which includes the biggest tech firms such as Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. Tesla reports earnings on July 26. “Tesla is highly correlated to megacap tech” and “this relationship has really decoupled in the near term,” Amy Wu Silverman, derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said in emailed comments. “When I ask around, the feedback I get is that this is related to their Bitcoin exposure and how it will have to be accounted for when they report earnings.” Tesla in February disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin after favorable comments about the largest cryptocurrency from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. The move sparked speculation that other companies would follow -- though few have. Tesla has since sold a portion of the holdings, and Musk has emerged as a critic of Bitcoin for reasons including energy consumption. Tesla has dropped almost 4% this month, while the Nasdaq 100 is up more than 2%. Bitcoin has dropped from a peak of almost $65,000 in mid-April to about $32,500 amid a broad retreat in investor appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Silverman noted that Tesla also has “extremely steep” skew, a measure of how expensive bearish options are relative to bullish ones. “This is highly unusual for Tesla which spends a lot of the time with ‘inverted skews’ because both institutions and retail adore buying out-of-the-money call options in the name,” she said. Those looking for bearish trades might do well to use put spreads to take advantage of the high skew, Silverman added.

The finance world has been rocked in recent months as retail investors, who strategize on internet platforms like Reddit and initiate trades on stock applications like Robinhood, take center-stage in the battle against hedge funds involved in shorts-selling attempts. According to news publication The New York Times, Robinhood now has more than 13 million active users. The application, which offers commission free stock trades and has an average user age of around 30, is planning to go public soon at a valuation of close to $50 billion.  Similarly, Reddit forums like WallStreetBets, which has more than 10 million users, are the social media platforms of choice for these retail investors to coordinate action against short-selling schemes. The popularity of stocks on these two platforms can offer market experts a glimpse into how these retail investors hope to shape the market dynamics. Some of the stocks presently popular on both platforms include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME).  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), the California-based electric vehicle and clean energy company, was buoyed by Robinhood and Reddit interest in the past months, registering a record rally through the COVID-19 pandemic that saw share price jump more than 700% before slowing down towards the end of April this year. This rally baffled market experts as the firm did not debut flagship new products or dazzle with record vehicle delivery numbers in 2020 because of the coronavirus lockdowns, highlighting the importance of Robinhood and Reddit interest. One of the most popular stocks on both platforms presently is AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), the movie theatre company. The company is in a short squeeze as Robinhood and Reddit users buy the stock and drive the share price up to the detriment of those trying to short-sell. Over the past three months, the share price of the company has jumped close to 500% and looks set to soar further as hype around the stock increases.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now. Philippe Laffont, the billionaire who runs New York-based hedge fund Coatue Management, is one of the few money managers who have successfully navigated the stock volatility associated with growth stocks in the past few years and provided investors with consistently handsome returns. Founded in 1999, the fund now oversees more than $18 billion in assets under management and boasts an average annual return of over 10% in the past decade. Laffont also controls a venture capital fund that invests in tech-related startups. Some of the top holdings in the Coatue's Q1 portfolio are Snowflake Inc. (NYSE: SNOW), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). Snowflake Inc. (NYSE: SNOW) only went public in September last year, raising more than $3 billion in a record offering that valued the company at over $33 billion. Since then, the share price of the cloud-based data storage provider has more than doubled and the firm now has a market cap of over $70 billion. As digital offerings explode, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE: SNOW) still has room to climb even higher.  One of the unexpected stocks in the otherwise tech-specific portfolio of the fund is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), the California-based mass media and entertainment firm. One of the reasons why Laffont is bullish on the firm is Disney+, the digital video streaming service owned by the media firm that has amassed more than 100 million users in just over a year. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), which owns some of the most famous theme parks around the world, has also benefited from the reopening of the economy.

TSLA,"If you feel like you're suddenly seeing that shiny metal ""T"" everywhere on the road, you're not mistaken. Electric vehicles sales are soaring, and Tesla is leading the charge. EV sales in the U.S. nearly doubled in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same time last year, says a new report by Experian, with Elon Musk's car company commanding a 71% share. Tesla also recently announced that it doubled its worldwide production, shipping more than 200,000 cars in the second quarter, up from 90,000 a year ago. But even though many Americans have decided a Tesla is worth the high sticker price, they could be in for a shock when they try to find affordable insurance for these technological and ecological marvels. While you’re going to save about $250 a month on gas, any electric vehicle will generally cost you more to insure. Why is that? Car insurance companies come up with rates based on a whole range of factors. So even if you have a spotless driving record, live in a low-crime area and take advantage of some driving discounts, your rate is still likely to go up compared to your gas-powered car. That’s because electric vehicles cost more outright and are more expensive to repair. The insurance company may deem you low risk to file a claim, but if anything happens to your car, it’s going to mean costly repairs. So your premiums will be set high to reflect that risk. If your premium with a gas-powered car is $1,000 a year, you’ll probably pay between $1,180 to $1,320 with an electric car, according to ValuePenguin. As a luxury car, Teslas are pricier still. Motortrend recently studied how much it would cost each year to insure the various Tesla models available. Among other factors, these averages assume the owner is a single 40-year-old man with a clean record and good credit score: Tesla Model 3: $2,114-$2,351 Tesla Model S: $3,673-$4,143 Tesla Model Y: $2,118-$2,227 Tesla Model X: $3,355-$4,025 Of course, your rates will vary from insurer to insurer — which is why you should always compare quotes from multiple insurers. Most electric cars generally cost more to buy than standard vehicles. And when they’re damaged, you may have a harder time finding a mechanic qualified to repair them — in addition to requiring more expensive and difficult-to-source parts.

The company was formerly known as Tesla Motors, Inc. and changed its name to Tesla, Inc. in February 2017. Tesla, Inc. was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California Earnings History The first thing I do when I look at stock is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has been able to communicate to the market. A stock that consistently beats is one that has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see. For TSLA, I see great history of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. There are three beats over the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last fours quarters works out to be 147%, which means that they are posting results that are more than what is expected. There was a monster beat four quarters ago (544%) and that skewed the average up quite a bit. Still, the company beats and that helps boost estimates higher and higher. Earnings Estimates Revisions The Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher. For TSLA, I see estimates moving higher. Over the last 60 days I am seeing several increases. This quarter has moved from 89 cents to $0.90. Next quarter has held still at $1.10. The full year number has increase from $4.25 to $4.30 over the last 60 days. Next year is at $6.27 and that is up from $6.26 over the same time horizon.

TSLA,"Elon Musk is toying with the cryptocurrency community once again. This time, the Tesla chief is sharing the love with Shiba Inu fans while poking the bitcoin crowd. Cryptocurrency investors know the influence that Musk seemingly has on the direction of the market, and many are trying to get in his good graces. The meme token has managed to do just that, as evidenced by one of Musk’s latest tweets. He randomly proclaimed that his “Shiba Inu will be named Floki,” seemingly in reference to the shipbuilder character on the series Vikings. The reference seems to suggest that the Shiba Inu team is building something Musk supports. The tweet amassed nearly 17K replies and 18K retweets. Musk flexed his muscle in the cryptocurrency market in which he has a love/hate relationship. The SHIB token is climbing higher by almost 9% and climbing while the broader cryptocurrency market remains in the doldrums.

While Musk is winning friends in meme coin circles, he is stirring things up among bitcoin investors, especially those who are all in on the leading cryptocurrency, known as maximalists. Musk, whose gripe against bitcoin is the energy consumption involved with mining, poked the bear, asking, “How many Bitcoin maxis does it take to screw in a lightbulb?” His clever tweet attracted a slew of responses, including the bitcoin bull himself, Michael Saylor, who cleverly replied, “If you give us 10 minutes, maybe we can hash out the answer.” The 10-minute nod is in reference to the time it takes for a block to be verified on the Bitcoin blockchain and for miners to be rewarded.

Jackson Palmer, a developer who helped to create Dogecoin in 2013, took to Twitter to label cryptocurrencies ""an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity"". ""The cryptocurrency industry leverages a network of shady business connections, bought influencers and pay-for-play media outlets to perpetuate a cult-like 'get rich quick' funnel designed to extract new money from the financially desperate and naive,"" Palmer wrote as part of a series of Tweets.

The price has since crashed down to $0.19 but is still well above where it has been for most of its life. Dogecoin's price rise coincided with a surge in interest and investment into the broader cryptocurrency space but with little of substance underlying its rally.

TSLA," Tesla (TSLA) stock has recently stalled under the $700 price level as it consolidates for its next move. Meanwhile, one Wall Street trader is pointing to its recent ""glass bottom"" chart formation as a sign that Tesla bulls are starting to show signs of life. Recently, on Yahoo Finance Live, Michele Schneider, partner and director of trading research and education at Marketgauge.com, broke down the particulars of this classically bullish pattern. She said that in May, Tesla stock fell below $600 per share, probing the $550 level, which had been its prior support in March.  Importantly, this was the lowest price level in 60 days, but price action quickly confirmed investor participation. The day after shares hit a price low, Tesla managed to close above the high of that reversal day, signaling a potential bottom when combined with the fresh 60-day low. ""That was really an amazing opportunity to get into Tesla because at that point you had about a $30 risk — which for a stock trading with that type of volatility is really good. It's like having a $2 risk for [a stock] like Apple (AAPL),"" said Schneider. After the bounce, Tesla rallied to the key $700 price level where it pulled back and began consolidating. Schneider said that a break through that level puts the possibility of the stock potentially reaching $800, adding that investors shouldn't pay too much attention to the company's earnings.  ""Tesla is more of a momentum stock than an actual stock based on its real valuation. So you can forget about all the fundamentals and really, in this case I think, watch those technicals for that set-up,"" she said.

TSLA,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares are back in vogue. The electric vehicle maker’s stock is up nearly 12% in three sessions, leaving them poised to erase the losses that piled up this year as investors moved out of growth stocks and sentiment shifted against the company. The latest surge reversed nearly two months of lackluster trading, when investors soured on the company amid growing competition threats from traditional automakers, signs of a potential sales slowdown in China and an ongoing semiconductor shortage. Those concerns may have taken a backseat this week as optimism about surging growth buoyed the broader market and President Joe Biden reached a deal with a group of Republican and Democratic senators on a $559 billion infrastructure plan. That package proposes investing heavily into developing the electric vehicle ecosystem in the U.S., promising to bolster Tesla and its competitors. Tesla shares rose as much as 6.3% to $697.62 on Thursday. The shares ended 2020 at $705.67. Some of the strength in the stock on Thursday could also be attributed to a tweet from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who said he will try to do his best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference in any future IPO of the Starlink unit of SpaceX.

And it could happen much sooner than most people realize, as some of the biggest names are already hopping on board. Amazon has already started making deliveries with electric vans in Los Angeles, as they’ve agreed to purchase 100,000 vans from EV startup, Rivian. The United States Postal Service just signed a 10-year, multi-billion dollar contract with Oshkosh Defense to produce thousands of electric mail trucks. And United Airlines just placed an incredible $1 billion order with EV manufacturer, Archer, for a fleet of electric air taxis. Legacy automakers are all making the shift too, rolling out their line of electric vehicles one by one. Ford is set to double their investment in EVs to $22 billion, and they’re planning to release their electric version of the Mustang and the F-150, the most popular vehicle in the U.S. Volkswagen is calling their 2021 electric crossover, the ID.4, “the most important new Volkswagen debut since the Beetle.” And General Motors has even announced they’ll stop making gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. Now, Biden has even announced plans to transition all government fleet vehicles to EVs. This electric revolution has already led to monster gains for EV companies throughout 2020. The EV van startup, Workhorse, saw gains of over 551%... Tesla’s shares shot up a massive 740%... And Blink Charging soared for incredible 1,740% gains last year. Now, many investors are looking ahead for the next big thing in the EV markets. And one Canadian company in EV related business has seen its momentum building steadily over the last year.

Musk had during an earnings call in January said he was ""highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year."" But in May, Tesla informed the California Department of Motor Vehicles that it may not achieve full self-driving technology by 2021 end. The automaker is under review by the California regulator, which is probing if the company violated regulations by falsely promoting its advanced driver-assistance systems as being ""full self-driving"". Tesla's driver assistant features, which it describes as ""autopilot"" or ""full self-driving"", are designed to make hands-on driving easier. Those features do not make the vehicle autonomous.

Tesla stock jumped 3.54% on Thursday to close at $679.82. Panasonic invested about $30 million to purchase 1.4 million Tesla shares at for $21.15 a share in 2010. At the end of March 2020, the value of that stake had increased to $730 million. Tesla has a battery supply arrangement with Panasonic and the stake sale will not affect the relationship, according to the report. But the report states that the sale comes as Tesla is diversifying its battery supply chain and that its relationship with Panasonic has been tense at times. Tesla has entered into battery supply deals with China’s CATL and South Korea's LG Energy Solution, Reuters reports. (See Tesla stock chart on TipRanks). On June 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained a Buy rating with a price target of $900 on Tesla stock. Jonas’ price target suggests 32.39% upside potential. The analyst outlined eight reasons why Tesla should seek an aggressive expansion strategy. For example, since cars don’t ship like phones, Jonas noted the importance for Tesla to produce within key markets. Additionally, the analyst believes that Tesla should aggressively reduce the price to prevent competition from big tech. Jonas further noted the importance of diversifying the supply chain outside of China. Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 9 Buys, 7 Holds, and 7 Sells. The average Tesla analyst price target of $620.70 implies 8.70% downside potential from current levels.

The post-pandemic marketplace, already under heavy strain amid fears of inflation and a dramatic drop in the prices of growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, has been thrown into more confusion in recent days as meme stock rallies, fueled by retail investor bets against the short-selling attempts of hedge funds, return to the fore. At the turn of the year, these meme stock rallies led to billions in losses for big finance capital, leading to regulatory probes and calls for policing around trading on applications like Robinhood.  Six months ago, the two primary actors at the center of the hedge fund versus retail investor battle were GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the video game and entertainment products retailer, and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), the movie theatre chain based in Kansas. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the focus of a short-selling attempt in early January, saw share price rise close to 1,500% in the first three weeks of the new year as retail investors, who used Reddit forum WallStreetBets to coordinate, spoiled hedge fund bets against the stock.  Similarly, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) was also the target of a short-seller scheme this year. The company has recently been involved in another short squeeze as the share price registers double digits growth amid reports that many shares of the firm are being held short.

TSLA,"Sound the alarm bells: it appears that some of the most fervent Tesla cultists could be beginning to stray from the path in what could be an ominous sign for an automaker that has relied heavily on its cult status to stay afloat. A new note from Bernstein this week suggests that enthusiasm could be waning for the Tesla brand, particularly in China. The note, which surveyed 457 owners, says that despite Tesla buyers remaining ""fervent supporters"" of the brand, more customers are likely to opt out of buying a Tesla in favor of buying a European luxury brand in future. Bernstein says the data could support ""initial buyer euphoria cooling off"" in addition to reflecting the growing choice of EVs that consumers have. The note also said that “China’s results – while statistically not conclusive – are modestly worrisome.” The note also pointed out what has been a half-decade-long ongoing problem for Tesla, service, which Bernstein called ""Tesla's Achilles heel”. It also wrote that lower-priced offerings from Tesla ""aren’t necessarily attracting a more mass-market buyer, a departure from our last survey”. Related: Solar Has An Unlikely New Enemy Recall, back in June we noted that Tesla's global EV market share had collapsed to 11% in April, from 29% in March. It marked Tesla's lowest monthly global market share since January 2019. The ""greater than usual drop"" came between the last month in Q1 and the end of the first month of Q2. In Europe, the company posted EV market share of just 2% compared to 22% in March. In the United States, market share fell to 55% versus 72% in March. While Tesla remains at the top of the heap in the U.S., there's no telling how long that is going to last. The company is now facing stiff competition from legacy automakers and is dealing with backlash from both dropping features and raising prices on its models, as we noted in June.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors Company GM, Ford Motor Company F and Tesla, Inc. TSLA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Teledyne Technologies is an excellent inflation play following the sizable increase in inflationary expectations from the FOMC's post-meeting projections. TDY's relative buoyancy amid last week's selloff reaffirms my confidence in this stock as a robust cyclical name to hold for the remainder of 2021. Analysts are increasingly optimistic about this stock, raising their near and long-term EPS estimates and driving TDY into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Teledyne's vast array of cutting-edge tech-driven products are utilized in critical industrial growth markets that heavily rely on its products. This allows the company to easily pass on their price increases to their end markets with little to no margin deterioration. TDY is an under-the-radar inflation play that hasn't gained the market traction that I believe it deserves. You can see this from both its lack of analyst coverage and relatively low daily market volume. Nevertheless, TDY is trading around its 50-day moving average (utilizing it as both a support and resistance), riding higher for the past month, heading towards my Fibonacci-derived price target of $495 (over 16% upside). Teledyne just closed an enormous synergy driving acquisition of FLIR Systems last month. These businesses have complementary product offerings in proprietary sensor technology that will provide immediate value to the combined enterprise. TDY investors were initially wary of this acquisition when announced on the first trading day of 2021 trading because of the 40% premium they offered for FLIR shares, catalyzing an immediate 7.5% pullback. However, it only took just over a week of trading for the stock to recover as investors saw the robust value proposition in this acquisition. FLIR continues to get awarded lucrative government contracts that drive revenue growth and visibility. The business keeps adding to its backlog of government contracts that range from the Pentagon to the French Defense Procurement Agency.

TSLA," A recent study by financial source DailyFX revealed that Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and GE (GE) are the most popular stocks for millennials and Generation Z investors. The study collected data from Robinhood and examined investing preferences among millennials and Gen Z across the United States and United Kingdom for the 12 months ending April 2021. DailyFX noted that GameStop (GME) was not included in the study ""as that would dominate the end results, skewing them for the search volume increases from Reddit-fueled activity."" Overall, the technology and automotive industries dominated the market for young people, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla generating significant investment activity. Interestingly, electric vehicle manufacturing company Nio (NIO) was the top security for millennial investors in 8 states, the most of any stock. Nio was the most popular stock in Georgia, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. The Chinese EV manufacturer has achieved high levels of success in the American stock market, despite not selling a single vehicle in the country. Sustainability has been a key factor in determining which stocks to buy for young investors. Plug Power (PLUG), an alternative energy company, was the top stock for the younger generations in seven states. In the U.S., the most popular stock overall for the combined millennial and Gen Z cohort was Apple, followed by Tesla and GE at number two and three, respectively. In the UK, Nio, Airbnb (ABNB), and Palantir (PLTR) were the younger generations’ most commonly traded stocks. Airbnb was devastated by a pandemic which saw activity in the short-term rental industry drastically reduced in 2020. But as restrictions have been lifted and summer travel picks up, investors have identified ABNB as a stock primed for a bullish future. Millennial and Gen Z investors are considerably more likely than older generations to finance investments through loans. A May 2021 MagnifyMoney survey found that 80% of Gen Z investors and 60% of Millennials surveyed admitted taking on loans to invest. Older generations were less likely to take out loans, with 8% of Gen Xers and 9% of Baby Boomers doing so. The youngest adults have also shown great interest in socially-responsible investments.

Very glad to be here, Brian. Now dual primary listing actually has a number of benefits. One is that the company can be actually listed independently in Hong Kong, which means that it does not rely on a listing status in the US to trade in Hong Kong. Most of the secondary listing Hong Kong actually rely on US listing. So a primary listing give us the independent listing and trading ability. Secondly is that the primary listing Hong Kong, that should give us the ability to be eligible for stock net, which means that the China-based A-Share investors can, through stock net, buy our shares in Hong Kong, which will give us the access to the Chinese capital markets, which also allows some of our customers can be our shareholders, which is also always our objective.

PETER RAWLINSON: Well, our reservations have just exceeded 10,000. They're bona fide reservations with appropriate deposits. Some people have even paid over $7,000 deposit. The reservations are coming from all sectors. There isn't really such a thing as a market for EVs, there's a market for cars. And with great EVs, like the Lucid Air that we're launching this year, we're going to get more penetration into the internal combustion engine market, more EVs taking the place of gasoline burners, and that's great for the planet.

We're opening this weekend here in the meatpacking district our new flagship studio, so come along and check out for yourself.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the Top 5 S&P 500 Stocks By Index Weight. Let's first try and understand what the S&P 500 is. The Standard and Poor's 500 consists of the largest companies listed on the stock exchanges in the United States of America and is a free-float weighted measurement stock market index. It is by far one of the most popular equity indices out there, and many investors, both individuals and corporates, try to ensure that their returns beat the S&P 500 index. Although there is significant turnover, many companies have been mainstays such as Johnson&Johnson (PFE), Bank of America (BAC), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). It isn't a passive index of the 500 largest companies as some people believe. It took Tesla Inc (TSLA) years to be included in the S&P 500 Index. At the time of the inclusion, Tesla Inc was the sixth largest company in the index. This means passive index investors didn't really benefit from Tesla's meteoric rise over the years. Many major investors out there even recommend simply investing passively in the S&P 500 index. Warren Buffett has been one of the biggest proponents of the index and has always recommended it for investment, along with other major investors such as John C. Bogle and Burton Malkiel, but this advice has always been contingent on the investor planning for a long term horizon rather than a short term horizon, as the returned are steady and compounded year on year. If you're looking for short term benefits, then other avenues may be better such as cryptocurrency, though generally the risks are significantly higher on such investments as well. The importance of the S&P 500 cannot be understated at all, and in fact, the performance of the index is one of the biggest indicators of the direction that the economy of the biggest superpower in the world is heading towards. The float adjusted market cap weighted index was launched back in March 4, 1957 and as at December 31, 2020, the index was worth more than $37.4 trillion at the end of May 2021.

BTC,"The crypto market was deeply in the red on Monday, extending a sell-off that began late last week and gathered pace over the weekend. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world's biggest cryptocurrency, was down 5.6% to $32,200 (£23,207) by 2.15pm in London. It marked the lowest level for bitcoin in nearly two weeks. Other major tokens were also in the red, with ethereum (ETH-USD) down 7.7% to $1,930 and XRP (XRP-USD) down 8.1% to $0.66. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), the joke token propelled into the mainstream earlier this year, was down 18.1% to $0.21.

The sell-off extends a slump that began late last week after the US Federal Reserve struck an unexpectedly hawkish tilt at its latest policy meeting. The central bank brought forward the timeline for future interest rate hikes, raising the prospect that cheap money may disappearing sooner than expected. The Fed's shift in stance sparked a move away from risk assets and cryptocurrencies have been caught up in the selling.

BTC,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been moving upwards since rebounding on June 22. It reached a local high of $34,881 the next day. Whether it finds support at the current price level or gets rejected will likely determine the direction of the future trend. Bitcoin has been moving upwards since June 22 after reaching a local low of $28,805. The bounce that followed was preceded by bullish divergences in both the RSI and the MACD signal line (blue lines). The next day, BTC reached a high of $34,881. However, it has been moving downwards since. While the bullish divergences have already played out, technical indicators are bearish. The MACD and RSI are both decreasing. The former is negative while the latter has fallen below 50. In addition to this, the Stochastic oscillator is very close to making a bearish cross (red circle). The closest support and resistance levels are at $31,300 and $41,500. The two-hour chart shows that BTC has already broken out from a descending resistance line, which had previously been in place since June 15. However, it was rejected by the 0.5 Fib retracement resistance level at $35,070. Currently, BTC is in the process of validating the line as support (green icon). The line also coincides with the 0.382 Fib retracement support level (white) Despite this, technical indicators do not show any bullish signs. The RSI has fallen below 50 and the MACD has given a bearish reversal signal. It’s not yet clear if the wave count is bullish or bearish. However, yesterday’s decrease below the $33,367 low (red line) suggests the latter. The increase from the lows looks to be a three-wave structure instead of a bullish impulse. For that to be true, the ongoing decrease would have to be a 1-2/1-2 wave structure. Therefore, a sharp decrease would follow. A move above the descending resistance line and the $33,869 high would suggest that this is not the case and the count is bullish instead. If BTC breaks out, it would likely mean that the current movement made up waves one and two (black) of a bullish impulse, that would complete a longer-term wave A (white). Therefore, the movement in the next few hours is crucial in determining the direction of the trend. For BeInCrypto’s latest bitcoin (BTC) analysis, click here.

BTC,"Check back at 8:30 a.m. ET for the results Bitcoin has experienced no shortage of news and announcements, as the seminal cryptocurrency attempts to mount a recovery following May’s rout and June’s outperformance over other major coins. The Fundamental Look Ahead of the 100th anniversary of China’s Communist Party, the government is continuing its crackdown on Bitcoin usage in the country. On Tuesday, July 6th, the People’s Bank of China warned local companies against providing any support or services to cryptocurrency-related services, this time focusing its attention on software provision. Some perceive the clampdown as an effort to prevent any embarrassing events from overshadowing the forthcoming anniversary and possibly fighting capital flight. Nonetheless, the clampdown might continue to pressure BTC prices over the near term. (See Bitcoin stock comparison on TipRanks) One of the most interesting outcomes from the exodus of miners from China was the major 28% downward mining difficulty adjustment on July 3rd. While the network hash rate fell to its lowest point since September of 2019, operational miners likely experienced a significant jump in profitability. That's because the adjustment made mining easier. In adoption news, payment services provider Allied Payment Network has embraced Bitcoin after partnering with New York Digital Investment Group. The provider will now offer Bitcoin payment services to its network of customers and clients, meaning that connected financial institutions can now offer their customers the ability to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin. Moreover, Allied has announced its intention to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury account. The other major event worth mentioning is the passing of Mircea Popescu, a famed Bitcoin agitator and maximalist known by the moniker “the Father of Bitcoin toxicity.” Popescu reportedly drowned off the coast of Costa Rica. The mysterious individual once threatened to dump a million Bitcoin on the market if proposed changes were made to the network, earning him the previously mentioned moniker. However, if true, there are concerns that his Bitcoin holdings may hit the market or be lost forever.

BTC,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been decreasing since being rejected at the $36,600 level on June 29. It’s potentially trading inside a short-term ascending wedge, which is normally considered a bearish pattern. BTC has been increasing since bouncing above the $31,400 horizontal support area on June 22. So far, it has managed to reach a high of $36,600, doing so on June 29. The upward movement was preceded by significant bullish divergence in the MACD, RSI, and Stochastic oscillator. However, neither has a bullish reading yet. The RSI is just below 50 and the MACD signal line is still negative. Furthermore, the Stochastic oscillator has already made a bearish cross. The BTC price fell yesterday but did not create a bearish engulfing candlestick. Nevertheless, it seems to have resumed its downward movement today. The main resistance area is at $40,550. This is a horizontal resistance and the 0.382 Fib retracement level. The two-hour chart shows that BTC is potentially trading inside an ascending wedge. The resistance line of the pattern has been touched multiple times while the support line is not yet confirmed since it has only been touched twice. There is strong support at $32,640 (the 0.618 Fib retracement support level) and the potential ascending support line of the wedge. The MACD and RSI are both decreasing, supporting the possibility that the price will fall towards this level. The longer-term count suggests that BTC is still in wave five of a bearish impulse. The aforementioned June 29 rejection occurred right at the 0.618 Fib retracement resistance level. it was likely the top of sub-wave two (black). While corrective structures are often contained inside parallel channels, the high failed to reach the resistance line of the channel (red arrow). In addition, BTC has now fallen below the midline of the channel, another bearish sign. A breakdown from the channel would likely confirm the downward trend and indicate that BTC will decrease towards $23,600 and potentially $19,800.

But Coinbase customers now have access to an ethereum competitor called Polkadot (DOT1-USD), which is gaining the attention of Wall Street. At a recent Yahoo Finance Plus webinar, Capital2Markets President Keith Bliss compared the two developer networks, which are designed to decentralized finance. ""Polkadot is an ethereum competitor and a lot of programmers are now using that blockchain to build applications off of, because they consider it a little bit safer. It appears to have plugged in some of the pinholes that you see in the ethereum blockchain that some programmers and engineers have cited as problems going forward,"" he said. Both platforms use smart contracts, but polkadot goes a step further, allowing developers to build their own blockchains that can connect to each other. Ethereum 2.0 is expected to add similar functionality when it goes live later this year or in 2021.  Polkadot does face headwinds though, not the least of which are crashing crypto prices, which are souring institutional interest and attracting regulatory scrutiny. Last Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delayed one of the many pending bitcoin ETFs before the agency. There's also no guarantee that polkadot will be widely adopted. Bliss urges crypto investors to do their own research and make sure the underlying business or concept is bona fide.

BTC,"Michele Schneider joins Jared Blikre to talk momentum trades and advanced charting on Wed, 7/14 at 2PM EDT  An analyst who predicted the bitcoin mid-May price slide says the cryptocurrency’s current range play is likely to be resolved on the higher side. “The consolidation phase itself is neutral, but we think a breakout is more likely than a breakdown,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a research note published on Monday. “Intermediate-term momentum has been improving based on the MACD histogram.” Bitcoin has been trading between $30,000 and $40,000 since late May. The price range has narrowed further in the past two weeks, with bulls unwilling to send prices above $36,000 and sellers refusing to step in below $32,000. Related: US Financial Giant Capital Group Buys 12% Stake in Bitcoin-Exposed MicroStrategy A big move looks overdue and could be bullish, as the weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has turned higher, having bottomed out in mid-June. The consecutive shallow bars below the zero line indicate seller exhaustion. The relative strength index continues to indicate oversold conditions with a below-30 print. “Intermediate-term oversold conditions have generated stabilization above $30,000, which has proven to be strong support for bitcoin,” Stockton said. According to Stockton, the expected breakout would be confirmed on consecutive daily UTC closes above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $35,500. That would the doors to the next resistance level, near $44,000. Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops as Traders Await June CPI Inflation Report The 50-day SMA is one of the most widely-tracked technical lines. Stockton mentioned it as the level to defend for the bulls back in April, when prices were trading well above average. The SMA support was breached on April 20 and was followed by a sell-off in May. At press time, bitcoin is trading little changed on the day near $33,200. A break below the long-held support at $30,000 could invite chart-driven sellers.

BTC,"In this series of articles, BeinCrypto explores the state of various cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States. This particular article will focus on the Kryptoin bitcoin ETF, which was first introduced in 2019. Kryptoin’s bitcoin ETF has been in the news since 2019 and may find approval alongside the cryptocurrency market’s success in 2021. Institutional involvement in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has ramped up in recent years. The turning point for this change was introducing the world’s first bitcoin derivative products by Cboe and CME in late 2017. In the years between then and now, several other reputable names in finance have also joined the cryptocurrency bandwagon. These include Intercontinental Exchange, the company that operates the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Several crypto-oriented hedge funds have also emerged of late. The most notable being Grayscale Investments. A recent forecast estimated that hedge funds would increase its exposure to cryptocurrency to 7% within the next five years. However, the average individual isn’t likely to approach a hedge fund or similar high-profile investment offerings. Instead, they’re much more likely to invest in a retail or consumer-focused product, similar to how index funds work in the world of traditional finance. To that end, a handful of North American companies have been trying to launch their own Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track bitcoin or ethereum’s price instead of a stock market index. The Kryptoin Bitcoin ETF is a financial product sponsored and launched by Kryptoin Investment Advisors LLC — a Delaware-based company. The firm is headed by Jason Toussaint, who was once the CEO of World Gold Trust Services. Most notably, the firm is the sponsor of the world’s largest Gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Toussaint has also taken up ETF and investment roles at Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Asset Management in the past. If approved, Kryptoin’s ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX exchange, according to the firm’s S-1 filing with the SEC on April 9. Notably, prior applications indicated that the firm was initially looking to be listed on the NYSE instead. According to a filing published by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF will trade under the KBTC ticker symbol.

Eric Rosengren included the stablecoin among what he termed new disruptors to short-term credit markets. A senior U.S. Federal Reserve official has called Tether’s USDT stablecoin a risk to the stability of the financial system. In a slide presentation Friday, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, listed tether among the “financial stability challenges” the U.S. central bank is watching.  Rosengren included the stablecoin among what he termed “new disruptors” to short-term credit markets. In an interview with Yahoo Finance the same day, he elaborated. “The reason I talked about Tether and stablecoins is if you look at their portfolio, it basically looks like a portfolio of a prime money market fund but maybe riskier,” he said. Tether “has a number of assets that, during the pandemic, the spread got quite wide on those assets.” Spread widening refers to a sell-off in the credit markets, when the difference in yield increases between a risky asset such as a corporate bond and one perceived as safe like a Treasury bond. “I do think we need to think more broadly about what could disrupt short-term credit markets over time, and certainly stablecoins are one element,” Rosengren said. “I do worry that the stablecoin market that is currently, pretty much unregulated as it grows and becomes a more important sector of our economy, that we need to take seriously what happens when people run from these type of instruments very quickly.” Read more: Strike Is Phasing Out USDT From Bitcoin-Based El Salvador Remittances, CEO Says Wall Street veteran and longtime Bitcoin supporter Caitlin Long found the remarks salient. “What’s interesting is [Fed governor Lael] Brainard and then [Chairman Jerome] Powell started talking ‘stablecoins.’ But now Rosengren talks ‘tether’ by name.

BTC,"VanEck has submitted an application with the U.S. SEC for a Bitcoin Strategy Fund that will invest in bitcoin futures contracts, ETPs, and pooled investment vehicles. Investment management company VanEck has filed yet another application with the United States, this time a prospectus for a bitcoin futures mutual fund. The “Bitcoin Strategy Fund” offers investment in bitcoin futures contracts, in addition to pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products with exposure to the cryptocurrency. It emphasizes that it does not invest in bitcoin directly. According to the filing, the fund will invest in “certain” bitcoin futures through a subsidiary of the fund that falls under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The fund’s investment in the subsidiary will not exceed 25% of the value of the fund’s total assets at each quarter-end of the fund’s fiscal year. Additionally, the fund may invest in restricted securities — securities acquired in unregistered, private sales from an issuing company — including private investment funds. The point about not investing in bitcoin directly is important, as the U.S. SEC is hesitant to approve anything that offers direct exposure to the cryptocurrency for fear of investor risk. This has been one of the key talking points in the ongoing review of ETFs, of which there are now several that the SEC has to deal with. The application joins a list of others by VanEck, which is going all-in with its hope that the SEC will approve one soon. It has already launched an ETP in Europe, granting exposure to blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. The SEC has been cagey about the applications being sent its way, but it could be that analysts believe that will soon change. VanEck is the most well-known of crypto ETF applicants, with the company already having applied for a Bitcoin ETF and Ether ETF. The former has been delayed by the SEC multiple times, most recently last week, with the new deadline being set to July.

Driving the price lower for bitcoin have been a multitude of concerns. First, regulators in China continue their crack down on mining in the country. Two, negative tweets on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining from Tesla CEO Elon Musk haven't helped bitcoin prices, either.  And finally, a more hawkish stance on interest policy from the Federal Reserve has dampened speculation in the crypto market.  “The crypto haters have enjoyed knocking the digital assets this week, but savvy investors aren’t spooked by the current volatility.

Binance was required to make clear on its website, social media platforms and all other communications that it is no longer permitted to operate in the UK, and must not carry out any regulated activities in Britain without prior consent.

BTC,"Robert Kiyosaki, author of New York Times bestseller “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” and founder of The Rich Dad Company, is sounding the alarm about an impending recession, recently tweeting a warning about an impending “biggest crash in world history.” He predicted that it would be a long economic downturn and encouraged people to buy and invest in gold, silver, and bitcoin (BTC-USD) while they can.  Kiyosaki joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he thinks a market crash is coming as well as his outlook for bitcoin and other stores of value. “What [economist James Rickards] says is quite accurate—the next crash is basically an avalanche waiting for the last snowflake, and since 2008 all they've been doing is piling more debt onto the mountainside,” Kiyosaki said. “And they're just waiting for the next snowflake to hit. And that's going to be the biggest in world history. I thought COVID was it, but they just added more debt onto the avalanche site.” In spite of all this, the Fed holds the view that this period of high inflation remains “transitory,” citing an accelerated economic recovery from the pandemic as businesses continue to reopen to full capacity. Kiyosaki compared bitcoin, gold, and silver to the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies, suggesting that he believes bitcoin and precious metals to be better stores of value to use as hedges against macroeconomic cycles. He noted that he was optimistic about crypto in spite of the recent crash, stating that he views it as an opportunity to buy more. Kiyosaki stated that he believes it is not a question of “if,” but “when” the Chinese yuan (CNHUSD=X) and the U.S. dollar are substituted for cryptocurrencies such as the “Fedcoin.” Though he conceded that there are many predictions surrounding the adoption of such a currency for widespread use, he is keeping an open mind. As for his advice on how people, especially young investors, can prepare for an impending crash, Kiyosaki says to “be an entrepreneur.” “The thing I say to young people, because Yahoo is for young people, I would say be an entrepreneur,” Kiyosaki said. “Be a capitalist, and build a business that does well in crashes, booms, or busts.” Kiyosaki also denounced the pursuit of living a “debt-free” lifestyle.

BTC," Anthony Di Iorio will be severing his major ties to the cryptocurrency industry and selling his current venture Decentral to start a philanthropic foundation in the next year, the Ethereum co-founder told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “I’m a crypto guy and I don’t want to be known as a crypto person,” he said. “I want to be known as a problem solver.” Concerns about his personal security figured “a good 20%” into his decision, he said. Related: Vitalik Buterin Is Involved in a New Documentary About Ethereum Di Iorio said that the new organization would use principles that he developed as a crypto entrepreneur and even possibly blockchain technology itself to address what he described as “large problems.” He will be funding the entity from his own holdings, which he declined to disclose, and money he earns from the sale of Decentral, which he valued at “a few hundred million dollars.” He has already spoken with potential suitors and anticipates selling Decentral for fiat currency or a stake in another business rather than crypto. In 2018 when ether‘s price was less than half its current level, Forbes said Di Iorio was worth as much as $1 billion. Two years ago, the 46-year-old Canadian who is widely known for his work on the Ethereum network, announced that he was retiring from Decentral, the wallet and crypto services provider that he founded, and would serve as board chairman. But within months, he had returned to a daily management role, delaying a long-desired, full-time commitment to philanthropy. While he will end his relationships with other blockchain firms in which he’s involved, he said that he was open to using blockchain technology along with other approaches in his forthcoming work. “There’s a middle ground and crypto is a tool in my tool belt,” Di Iorio said. Related: Valid Points: The Problem With MEV on Ethereum He said that he has already hired a public relations firm to work with his foundation and that “we’re looking to move forward and scale,” including hiring employees.

BTC,"Speaking at Talent Land Jalisco 2021, multi-millionaire American philanthropist and entrepreneur Steve Wozniak has become the latest prominent figure to throw his weight behind Bitcoin. In an interview with El Sol de Mexico (one of Latin America’s biggest media outlets), the tech visionary revealed that he believes in the future of BTC as a digital gold asset, labelling Bitcoin as a product of “mathematical genius”. Wozniak’s support for Bitcoin comes at a time of rising inflation rates due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and follows many institutional moves into cryptocurrency as a hedge on the debasement of the USD. The Apple Co-Founder highlighted the promise of Bitcoin over other traditional inflation hedges such as precious metals suggesting that, unlike BTC, “gold is limited and you have to look for it”. This comes at a time when understanding of BTC as a secure means of protecting savings is entering the mainstream, with calls for Americans to hold BTC for retirement from Senator Cynthia Lummis (Wyoming – Republican). Nevertheless, this isn’t the first time Wozniak has marvelled at the wonders of Bitcoin. In an interview in 2018 he argued: “Man makes up currencies, controls them, issues new US dollars every year; Bitcoin is immune to that.” And in another interview with CNBC he said “only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that”. However, when asked about whether he personally invested in BTC he revealed “I do not invest in Bitcoin, but I believe in it for the future”. In 2019, Wozniak reportedly sold all of his Bitcoin holdings (bought at $700 per BTC) amid a turbulent and volatile long-winter for the asset. Speaking at the Nordic Business Forum, Wozniak said: “I wanted to experiment with it…when it shot up high, I said I don’t want to be one of those people who watches and watches it and cares about the number. I don’t want that kind of care in my life. Part of my happiness is not to have worries, so I sold it all and just got rid of it.” While Wozniak might not personally hold BTC, this doesn’t mean that he isn’t a proponent, user, and visionary in the cryptocurrency space.

BTC,"Stocks extended gains on Tuesday, with equities steadying following concerns over the path forward for monetary policy.  The S&P 500 advanced to end within striking distance of a record high. The Dow also added to gains, a day after the 30-stock index jumped by the most since March. The Nasdaq reached a record intraday and closing high. Cryptocurrency prices were broadly lower as concerns over tighter regulatory actions from China continued to weigh, and tokens from Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to the meme-based Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) added to recent losses. Bitcoin prices fell below $30,000 and erased year-to-date gains at their intraday lows. Tuesday's session saw traders turn back toward tech stocks, with ""reopening"" stocks in the travel industries including airlines and cruise lines slumping after the Federal Reserve's increased inflation outlook raised concerns that higher prices would ultimately weigh on the economic recovery. According to some traders, now that the Fed has signaled it would move to stem fast-rising inflation, some of the longer-term allure of the cyclical trade may be lifted.  ""I think the question is going to be here is, we were priced very dovishly going into the Fed. We appear to now be priced quite hawkishly. Clearly, the right outcome is somewhere in the middle,"" Stuart Kaiser, UBS head of equity derivatives research, told Yahoo Finance. ""So will energy benefit from a rebalancing of those expectations? Potentially.

BTC,"The total open interest in the bitcoin futures market is sitting at $11.3 billion, down 59% from its April 13 peak of $27.3 billion according to Arcane Research.  The report said the downward trading indicates that institutional investors are being “cautious” at the moment. It also notes that three-month futures in bitcoin are in backwardation, meaning they are traded at a discount to current spot prices. That is generally perceived to be a bearish signal.  Open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a share of total bitcoin futures was climbing at the end of May, but is now trading downward. The CME’s open interest is currently sitting at 12.2% of the bitcoin futures market, according to the report. That puts it in fourth place, behind retail platforms Binance (22.5% of total open interest), OKEx (14%) and Bybit (12.9%).

The world’s leading economy is lagging in the cryptocurrency game. South American giant Brazil and Middle Eastern nation Dubai have launched their Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The ETFs began trading yesterday, the same day the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on yet another Bitcoin ETF. The Brazilian Bitcoin ETF, called the Bitcoin ETF QBTC11, obtained the green light from the country’s regulatory agency in March. Bitcoin ETF QBTC11, launched by QR Capital, began trading on the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3). Meanwhile, the Dubai Bitcoin ETF was launched by the Canadian asset management firm 3iQ. Dubai regulators approved the ETF proposal in April, and it began trading on the Nasdaq Dubai bourse a few hours ago. Market analysts believe that Bitcoin ETFs would make it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin ETFs, institutional investors can trade cryptocurrencies without actually holding the coin. Bitcoin ETFs are now available in a few countries, including Canada, Brazil and Dubai. However, the United States is yet to approve one despite dealing with numerous proposals. The US SEC announced yesterday that it had postponed its decision on the Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF application until August 10. The SEC was supposed to decide on June 26. However, it has extended the review period by another 45 days. This is the third application it has postponed the decision process so far this year, after making similar moves with the WisdomTree and VanEck proposals. Some analysts have tied Bitcoin’s price prediction to the approval of an ETF in the United States. With a Bitcoin ETF in the US, the cryptocurrency market could be exposed to billions of dollars. The crypto market could also achieve the mainstream status it is seeking.

While BTC created several long lower wicks below this area, it has not managed to reach a close below it. Therefore, the support area is still intact. Despite this occurrence, technical indicators are bearish. The MACD is negative and decreasing, the RSI has fallen below 50, and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bearish cross. The 0.618 Fib retracement support level is located at $27,050. The daily chart shows that BTC has been trading in a range between $31,300 and $40,550 since May 19.

Until BTC breaks out or down from this range, the trend cannot be clearly determined. The two-hour chart shows that BTC is trading inside a descending parallel channel (black) since June 29. While inside the pattern, it has broken out from a shorter-term channel (white). Both the RSI and MACD are bullish and increasing. Therefore, a breakout from the longer-term channel would be likely. The wave count suggests that this is a complex W-X-Y corrective structure. If so, BTC is currently in the Y wave.

BTC,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has joined a growing chorus of analysts suggesting that a wave of new Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares hitting secondary markets might be good for bitcoin prices.   The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world’s largest digital-asset fund, allows institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through shares in the trust, which now holds 654,600 BTC. That’s about 3% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The institutional investors can buy into the fund at its net asset value – essentially, the value of the underlying bitcoin – but they are subject to a lockup period of six months. Because so many investors bought into the trust early this year, many of those lockups are now expiring, meaning more GBTC holders will soon be able to sell their shares on the secondary market.   Related: France Tests CBDC Flows With Singapore Using Automated Liquidity Pool A widely cited report from the JPMorgan suggested that the GBTC “unlocks” might lead to “downward pressure on GBTC prices and on bitcoin markets more generally.” But cryptocurrency analysts and investors, including Amber Group and Arca Funds, have suggested that the GBTC unlockings might actually be good for bitcoin prices.   According to a report from Kraken Intelligence, recent data indicates that close to 40,000 BTC worth of GBTC shares will unlock in July. That works out to about $1.36 billion, based on a bitcoin price of $34,000.  “Despite 40K BTC worth of GBTC shares unlocking in July, market structure suggests that the unlock will not weigh materially on BTC spot markets anytime soon, if at all, like some have claimed,” Kraken Intelligence wrote in the report.  According to regulatory filings, most of the shares that will be unlocked in July are owned by large institutions. Kraken said that those large institutions “presumably bought GBTC shares with BTC to harvest the premium to net asset value (NAV) that the shares were trading at.” Related: Economic Union of 15 West African States Voices Concerns Over Crypto Volatility “Whether these buyers of GBTC are market participants who hedge their purchase by selling BTC or are new, natural buyers, will likely determine what impact, if any at all, the sale of GBTC shares could have on the cryptocurrency,” Kraken wrote.

BTC," Amid the growing geopolitical threat of ransomware, crypto has become a stalking horse. Following a slew of high-profile exploits, there have been calls to ban or surveil blockchain networks, with the thinking that bitcoin catalyzes cybercrime.  The risks of ransomware are real: Any organization that relies on computers may be vulnerable to digital extortion. The threat isn’t always clear: Malware can be developed or deployed by individuals, state-backed groups or hacking collectives. And the price is high: Computer hijackings can disrupt critical infrastructure from the electricity grids to watersheds, endangering lives and economies.

You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Related: Inflation Is Rampant. Is It Time to Buy Bitcoin? Considering the amorphous threat that ransomware presents, crypto seems like a vector for concrete action. After all, the Colonial Pipeline hackers were paid in BTC. So was REvil, a group that once attacked Apple, and which was paid $70 million in bitcoin for its recent Kaseya exploit. A new crowdfunding site, Ransomwhe.re, looks to track bitcoin payments to wallets associated with ransomware gangs. But blaming crypto for the rise in ransomware is a mistake, said Marcus Hutchins, a British computer security researcher with a storied career in the malware industry. In a video titled “Why Destroying Bitcoin Wouldn’t Stop Ransomware,” Hutchins notes that hackers will find a way, with or without bitcoin. “Cryptocurrency has certainly made ransomware more accessible and contributed to its proliferation, but without it these kinds of attacks would have persisted,” he told CoinDesk. When the malware industry first emerged in 2012, it was the norm to accept U.S. dollars for exploits.  While the recent trend of corporate hacks has primarily been funded through crypto – Chainalysis found crypto payments to ransomware spiked to $412 million last year – that’s not reason enough to take action against a nascent industry. Related: State of Crypto: Binance Is Firmly in the Regulatory Crosshairs “We have absolutely no data on what corporate ransomware attacks might look like without cryptocurrency.

BTC," The simplistic days of trading bitcoin by scanning technical charts and the spot market order book are passé. The bitcoin market has matured since the March 2020 crash, and participants can no longer turn a blind eye toward macroeconomic developments and activity in the futures and options market.  That was especially the case on Thursday, when the risk-off mood on Wall Street put downward pressure on bitcoin and pushed the cryptocurrency toward $30,000 support, which, if breached, could invite more selling pressure from options traders, leading to a quick slide.  Related: Bitcoin to Become Dominant in Global Finance by 2050, Most Panelists in New Study Say With bitcoin locked in the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, many options traders have been selling puts at the $30,000 strike and selling calls at the $40,000 strike. These trades were booked on Deribit and other crypto-derivatives exchanges in hopes the consolidation would continue, leading to a drop in the implied volatility and the value of calls and puts.  A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy. In plain English, selling a put option is akin to offering insurance to the put buyer against a price sell-off below a particular level – in this case $30,000.  “After the mid-May selling, volatility hit peak heights, but since then spot prices have been trading in a base range. These types of consolidation periods are perfect environments for lower-volatility trades,”  said Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of Genesis Volatility. “The main idea is for prices to meander between support and resistance, and traders sell options expecting these levels to hold.” But bitcoin is pushing toward the lower end of the range at $30,000. If that level breaks, traders who sold puts at that level may resort to hedging downside risk by shorting bitcoin futures or selling bitcoin in the spot market. That, in turn, could add to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency, leading to a more profound price drop.  Related: Bitcoin Heads for Its Worst Weekly Close in Over a Month “If support or resistance levels break, traders will need to quickly hedge because prices will move to new levels fast,” Magadini said. “The hedging activity from various traders on the same side of the volatility trade also","Options traders have been selling puts at $30,000 strike.

BTC,"According to the stock-to-flow deflection chart, today, bitcoin is the most undervalued with respect to the last 10 years of its history.  A similar situation occurred in the middle of the 2017 bull market. After which, the BTC price continued its exponential growth. Additionally, bitcoin is deviating from its 11-year uptrend line. The deviation reaches 36% negative. This gives an additional signal that the value of BTC is undervalued and also shows room for upside. The peaks of previous bull markets led the major cryptocurrency high above this trendline. In a recent tweet, cryptocurrency trader @CryptoMichNL pointed out that bitcoin’s price deflection chart from the popular stock-to-flow model is at its lowest level in over 10 years. Today’s BTC price is oscillating around $40,000, while according to the model, it should already be slightly above $100,000. The last time such a significant negative deviation occurred was in the early days of the network development. Back then BTC cost less than $0.1 in October 2010 (yellow circle). BTC stock-to-flow deflection / Source: Glassnode Moreover, the chart shows another moment in the history of the major cryptocurrency when the deflection almost touched current levels (blue circle). This was in July 2017, in the middle of the previous bull market, when bitcoin cost around $2,000. A few months later, its price continued an exponential rise. This took it to the historical all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017. The stock-to-flow deflection chart, therefore, not only gives a general indication of the relative value of BTC. It also provides an additional argument that the cryptocurrency market is in the middle of a long-term bull market. This remains in line with a number of on-chain analysis indicators that are currently providing similar readings. The stock-to-flow model popularised by @100trillionUSD reaches back to the now-classic book “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous. It expresses the relationship of stock, circulating supply, flow, or new production, of any asset whose quantity increases over time. For bitcoin, it is the circulating supply of coins in relation to newly mined coins. Bitcoin stock-to-flow model / Source: Glassnode The strength of this model lies in its historical effectiveness and its accounting for halving cycles (colors).

BTC,"After China announced that it would begin ramping up its efforts to restrict the mining of cryptocurrency, the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to below $30,000 earlier this week, trading at a value not seen since the turn of the new year. The cryptocurrency has since rebounded slightly, now holding at a level just above $32,000. Though the news and subsequent crash may have caused short term headaches in the crypto market, China’s crackdown on mining may actually benefit crypto in the long run, according to some experts.  “I think it's actually fantastic news for the Bitcoin ecosystem,” Peter Smith, Blockchain.com co-founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance Live. “You're going to see a diversification of mining operations around the world. We've been seeing that trend over the last two years, as large mines are built in Europe, the U.S., and a variety of other geographic locations—but that trend is going to accelerate hard now.” Smith cited the growing concern of Bitcoin mining becoming too highly concentrated in mainland China as a reason for a positive outlook on the crackdown. He predicts that over the next three to four years, this will yield a net positive for crypto as mining firms sell off their bitcoin and move their operations overseas. Chinese mining firms have already begun planning to shift their businesses abroad, with companies eyeing countries ranging from the U.S. to Kazakhstan. According to Chris Zhu, owner of Chinese mining service platform INBTC, approximately 10% to 20% of miners in China have already initiated their move. ""We spent around ten days getting to Sichuan, only for operations to stop there too,"" Zhu told AFP. ""It's going to be tough to continue here."" As for what the implications of Beijing’s restrictions on mining will have in terms of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), Smith believes there is not enough available information to make a judgement call. According to him, the “vast majority” of mining operations being built today are powered by some form of clean energy. “You're going to see mining companies start to disclose where they're getting their energy,” Smith added. “And for the most part, Bitcoin mines are powered in places where there's really low energy cost.” Crypto mining’s issues surrounding social impact need to be “figured out” before large asset managers begin significant investment campaigns, Smith said.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 0.7%, trading at $34,891 on Wednesday morning. “If we compare today to the April highs, we can say with absolute certainty that the hype has left the market,” said Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics. He also noted that the average number of transactions per day on the bitcoin blockchain has dropped to levels “not seen since the darkest days of crypto winter” which was about a decade ago. But he said this is a good thing as the average transaction fee for sending bitcoin, which at one point was more than $60, has come back down to a ""manageable level"" of around $8. “As someone who uses the main chain fairly frequently, I'm kind of grateful for the discount, even though it means the value of my stack has been slashed.” Bitcoin had earlier crashed because of regulatory action in China, which included a crackdown on crypto mining.

Over the weekend the Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance, one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, to remove all advertising and financial promotions by 30 June.

BTC,"El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has offered to give away $30 in Bitcoin to all citizens who decide to download the government’s BTC wallet called Chivo, which is slang for “cool” in the the Central American nation. The country’s authorities are trying in that way to encourage people to use cryptocurrency in order to minimise the usage of the American dollar. People will be able to download Chivo simply by using their phone number and ID number. Beginning from September 7, Bitcoin will become the legal currency in this country and Bukele hopes that this could attract many investments and improve citizens’ buying power. He also added that bank accounts in dollars will remain in dollars, as well as salaries and pensions. “Why create this law? Because Bitcoin has a $600 billion market capitalisation globally and if we do this, investors and tourists who own Bitcoin will come to the country and benefit Salvadorans and the economy,” he stated. He also added that there are positive and negative sides to printing money. Still, as Salvadorans use the American dollar as their legal currency, they don’t feel any positive sides of printing money in the US. However, what they feel is the negative influence of such printing that leads to inflation. In times of inflation and, therefore, recession, people tend to turn their investments to other assets such as real estate, precious metals, or, in this case, cryptocurrency. Bukele explained that the consumers will be able to pay businesses with Bitcoin from their wallets for items listed in dollars. However, if business owners want to receive USD, there is a button in the Chivo application that turns the Bitcoin to dollars. El Salvador is the first country in the world that started accepting Bitcoin as legal tender and, therefore, all who do business in the country will be forced to accept it. However, a private citizen has the opportunity to choose whether to accept Bitcoin or not. Still, if it’s known that the minimum wage in the country is around $430 (but starts from as low as $103), there is a reasonable belief that plenty of people will be accepting BTC.

According to the Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) of Costa Rica, a 41-year-old man going by the same name was found dead. The report did say that the deceased was Polish, but he is actually Romanian. While the original report did have a discrepancy about his country of origin, the death has been confirmed by a number of sources to whom Popescu was close. “The events occurred around 8:30 am when Popescu entered the sea to swim in the Tramonto sector, was swept away by the current and died on the spot,” the local report states. The report also states that lifeguards remind tourists that the area is not a beach for swimming. “The current there can drag you out for miles and if you swim against it, you die of exhaustion.” The polarizing figure in the cryptocurrency industry leaves behind a checkered legacy along with a treasure chest of virtual currency. The Romanian-born Popescu founded Polimedia, an enterprise resource planning firm, in 2007. What he is really known for, however, is his life after beginning work as a Bitcoin blogger in 2012. This led him to be known as one of the pioneers and early adopters of digital assets.

Bitcoin’s seven-day average hashrate stood at 90.6 EH/s on Tuesday, up slightly from 90.5 EH/s on Monday. The number is still down by roughly half from the peak rate reached in mid-May, according to data from Glassnode.  The majority of the reduction stemmed from China’s move to shut down cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, with a little bit from Iran, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform. Related: Soros Fund Management Is Said to Be Trading Bitcoin: Report “We believe there isn’t much active hashrate left in China,” Doctor said in an email to CoinDesk. “What is left is probably not mining openly, and may continue until either they get shut down or they can get equipment out of China and find an alternative place to move them.” Meanwhile, the mean block time for bitcoin, which measures the length of time it takes to create a new block, has fallen back to 16 minutes, after it surged to 23 minutes on Sunday, the highest level since 2010, according to Glassnode. Though block time fluctuates naturally, the rise in block time could be a result of Chinese miners shutting down their current operations, according to several mining sites. As the hash power declines, it takes longer for miners to solve the puzzles and create a new block.  Bitcoin, which is designed to have a target block time of 10 minutes, will see its difficulty level reduced when the block times are greater than expected.

BTC,"The Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate has dropped to a 13-month low in the aftermath of China’s latest crypto mining restrictions. BTC’s hash rate (SHA256) plummeted to 58.4 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) on Sunday, following a fleeting recovery above 100 EH/s over the course of the last week. The hash rate reflects the amount of BTC miners actively trying to validate (mine) blocks on the BTC chain, and this massive drop is reflective of Chinese miners shutting down operations amidst China’s great Bitcoin mining migration (representing 65% of global BTC miners). The BTC network difficulty rate is due to adjust at the end of this week; and analysts are expecting to see a reflective drop of over 20% from around 20 trillion to 16 trillion. This is a bullish sign, and can be read as healthy news for the BTC network indicating a potential short-term bull run (as BTC price generally increases when the hash rate declines). Beijing’s two birds; one stone policy move to shutdown BTC mining operations is aimed at ensuring the domestic supremacy of their new Digital Yuan over the BTC as a means of starving off dollarisation of cross-border commerce and restricting uncontrolled capital outflows, alongside reducing the China’s carbon footprint and helping to balance the strained national power grid. The market has responded favourably to the hash rate decline, with Sunday’s price rally peaking at 8% after a troubled week of volatility. Hash Rate can be viewed as a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target, so simply the more miners actively trying to find a hash, the higher the Hash Rate. Mining of the BTC chain (SHA256) is distributed across 16 known mining pools, however, there are an increasing number of mystern hash captures (unknown miners) that regularly comprise around 7.5% of Hashes. Some analysts speculate many of these mystery hash captures are done by Iran, however, the exodus of Chinese miners will likely see this number increase as some move into decentralised operations. The difficulty rate automatically adjusts on a fortnightly basis so as to maintain consistent block times of around 10 minutes per block; this ensures blocks are added at regular intervals into the BTC chain. This is a critical data point for miners as it’s closely linked to their profit margins; effectively acting as the grim reaper of miner capitulation.

BTC,"The cryptocurrency market has shrugged off news of Britain’s financial watchdog banning one of the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchanges from operating in the country. Over the weekend the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) ordered Binance Markets to remove all advertising and financial promotions by Wednesday 30 June. In one of the most significant moves by a regulator to date, the FCA said that the firm must not carry out any regulated activities in Britain without prior consent. Binance, which was founded by Canadian-Chinese developer Changpeng Zhao, is now required to make clear on its website, social media platforms, and all other communications that it is no longer permitted to operate in the UK. Despite the ban, Bitcoin rose more than 5% on Monday to $35,017 (£25,188), although it is still lower than at the start of the month following China’s recent crackdown on bitcoin miners. The wider cryptocurrency market also pushed ahead, with ethereum (ETH-USD), the world’s second largest coin, up 10% as average transaction fees on the coin dropped to their lowest since December 2020. Elon Musk-favourite dogecoin (DOGE-USD) also climbed 3.4%. According to CoinGecko, the broad crypto space was up around 8% to $1.43tn on Monday morning. “We’re seeing the $30,000 level on bitcoin being defended quite well with a number of tests at that level over the past month,” Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Luno Pte, told Bloomberg. “We saw a lot of downward pressure on prices being defended, so this looks quite bullish at this point.” It comes amid a crackdown on the cryptocurrency sector as money laundering and fraud cases rise globally. It also comes just days after the Japanese financial regulator issued a consumer warning against Binance. US and German regulators have also raised concerns over the firm’s activities in the past. Since the start of this year, crypto-related businesses must register with the FCA before doing business in the UK, however, most firms have been granted “temporary registration” until July. Earlier this month, the watchdog said that just five firms had registered, and that the majority were not yet compliant. On Sunday, Binance said on Twitter: “Binance Markets 'does not offer any products or services via the Binance.com website'.

BTC,"As Bitcoin and other digital coins rise in popularity, so have the number of gripes with the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., according to a new study. Coinbase was the most complained-about crypto digital wallet in the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau’s complaint database, according to a study done by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, with the volume of filings — albeit starting at a low level — accelerating this year.  “Coinbase should be investigating consumer complaints in a timely manner, [and] it should be hiring staff to answer the phone,"" Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the federal consumer program at U.S. Public Interest Research Group, told Yahoo Money. ""Consumers say it isn't doing either.” Since November 2019 through December 2020, Coinbase received just seven ""mobile wallet"" complaints each year. But starting this year through April, consumers filed more than five times that average each month, hitting a high of 62 in March. The increase follows the meteoric rise in value of many digital coins.   Most complaints revolved around issues managing, opening, and closing individual mobile wallet accounts. According to U.S. PIRG, of the Coinbase complaints that included narratives, 25% referenced bitcoin, 6% noted ethereum, and 6% mentioned litecoin. Read more: Bitcoin and crypto: 14 terms you should know PIRG noted that many of the complaints claim issues when trying to retrieve money from the service. For instance, one person, who eventually received monetary relief, wrote that “Coinbase has my bitcoin stuck in a ‘vault’ unable to be accessed by me.” Another consumer wrote a similar complaint, saying “I have been trying to withdraw my coins out of the vault, but they are stuck.” A vault is a digital wallet that can receive cryptocurrency, but has optional security features that add additional verification steps to withdraw funds. You can add funds to your vault by sharing your vault address or by transferring from your wallet to your vault. Coinbase itself said it's beefing up its customer support when contacted by Yahoo Money about the study. “In the past few months, we have quadrupled our capacity across our support team, and have delivered new technology and methods to resolve our customers’ most pressing issues faster,” a Coinbase spokesperson said.

BTC,"The amount of bitcoin held on exchanges has declined to a six-month low as the price of bitcoin has seen a 47% decline since its previous all-time high.  Bitcoin held on exchanges has seen a continuous decline over the past couple of weeks. The supply held on exchanges has been declining since Mid-May. The current supply on exchanges based on the percentage of the total supply saw a new six-month low being hit.   On-chain analysis company Santiment tweeted the statistic, saying, “The ratio of Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has encouragingly slid down to its lowest since early January. The 6-month low is a promising sign, as it generally will indicate that there is a decreased risk of more major BTC selloffs.” According to Santiment, the decline in bitcoin held on exchanges is a positive thing. The lack of bitcoin in exchanges means there cannot be any major sell-offs like the ones already seen this year. While bitcoin has witnessed a two-month correction from its all-time high of $64,000. It appears that there is still plenty of accumulation going on at this price range. Whales recently caused the biggest daily accumulation spike, with over 60,000 BTC being purchased in a single day. Bitcoin saw a price surge of 5% over the weekend before a correction on Monday took the crypto back down to $33,500. Currently, bitcoin is consolidating inside a price range of $31,400 and $40,550. Bitcoin also recently experienced a dramatic decline in mining difficulty. Following China’s extended ban on mining crypto in the country, mining companies have been pulling out of China en masse. The removal of Chinese miners has seen fewer miners operating at present. Which has seen the hash rate decline dramatically. The total hash rate recently hit a 19-month low of 87.6 TH/s.

BTC,"A deal between enterprise payments giant NCR and digital asset management firm NYDIG could see 650 US banks offer bitcoin purchases to an estimated 24 million customers.  For example, community banks like North Carolina-based First Citizens Bank will be able to offer their clients cryptocurrency trading. Additionally, customers of credit unions such as Bay Federal Credit Union in California can also use mobile applications built by the payment’s provider. Atlanta-based NCR decided to capitalize on the demand it had been seeing from banks and credit unions. It was also tired of seeing crypto-purchases made from their accounts to outside exchanges. Founded in 1884 as the National Cash Register, the company employs 34,000 people and does business ranging from digital banking service to ATMs. However, by now giving their clients a way to buy cryptocurrency, NCR is in direct competition with those cryptocurrency exchanges. To help facilitate things, NCR will opt to have NYDIG take care of custody services. This way, they are responsible for dealing with the regulatory requirements related to actually holding cryptocurrency. NYDIG has already done a bit of work to further facilitate crypto adoption in the past year. Last month, it teamed up with fintech behemoth Fidelity National Information Service to provide the same service of access to crypto assets. The head of bank solutions at NYDIG, Patrick Sells, announced that hundreds of banks had already signed up for the program. The majority of these banks that have signed up are smaller institutions, but NYDIG was also in talks with some bigger banks. Late last year, Massachusetts Mutual announced a $100 million investment in Bitcoin, making its purchases through NYDIG. MassMutual also bought an equity stake worth $5 million in NYDIG.

BTC,"It's time to back up the truck and buy the beat-up shares of pioneering crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), contends Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau.  Coinbase shares don't deserve to be swept up into the latest crypto winter, according to Lau.  ""We think Coinbase should not trade in lockstep with bitcoin because bitcoin can be very volatile, but at the same time because of their volatility it drives higher trading volume. It is similar to all the traditional exchanges, and we think that it's still a misunderstanding in the market that people think Coinbase should trade along with bitcoin going forward,"" Lau said on Yahoo Finance Live moments after releasing a bullish research note on the company.  Lau reiterated his Outperform rating on Coinbase along with a 12-18 month price target of $440. In effect, Lau is looking for Coinbase shares to nearly double within an 18 month timespan.  Here are key aspects to Lau's call: Stronger than expected second quarter volumes.  Wall Street analysts will likely be forced to raise their 2021 estimates in light of a strong second quarter for volumes.  Concerns of Coinbase cutting its fees are overblown and will subside.  That being said, Coinbase shares have been swept up into the downdraft in crypto prices going on for months already. From the record highs of more than $63,000 in mid-April, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has shed about 50% (including a trip below the $30,000 level). Major sell-offs have spread to other top cryptos such as dogecoin and ethereum amid fears of regulator crackdowns in the U.S. and China.  Coinbase shares are down about 30% over the past three months. At $234.88, Coinbase shares trade well below the $328.88 level set on its Nasdaq debut in mid-April.  The pullback comes despite Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas reiterating in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live that the second quarter started off strong. Said Lau in his note, ""Looking ahead, we believe management will continue to strategically increase contributions from 1) recurring revenue (e.g., the Coinbase Earn campaign, staking, and M&A) and 2) altcoins. Coinbase indicated ~40% of its trading volume in 1Q came from altcoins, materially lower than peers (e.g., ~85% of spread revenue for Voyager).

BTC," Bitcoin (BTC) decreased considerably on July 13, resuming the descent that began the previous day and hit a low of $32,202. So far, BTC has continued moving downwards in the early hours of July 14. However, it’s rapidly approaching a confluence of support levels. BTC is still trading inside the range of $31,300 and $40,550 that’s been in place since May 19. Currently, it’s trading slightly above the $31,300 horizontal support area. The price has been moving downwards since July 12 after it reached a local high of $34,678. The ongoing descent has caused daily time-frame indicators to turn bearish. The MACD has given a bearish reversal signal and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bearish cross (red icon). The RSI is also below 50. Therefore, daily signals are bearish. The two-hour chart shows that BTC has been trading inside a descending parallel channel since June 29. Such patterns often contain corrective structures. In addition to this, the movement inside the channel looks extremely gradual and choppy, making it unlikely that it’s part of a bearish impulse. Technical indicators do not yet show any signs of a bullish reversal. However, the two-hour RSI is approaching oversold levels, which have initiated strong bounces over the past month (green icon). In addition to this, BTC is trading at a confluence of support levels at $31,640. This is the 0.618 Fib retracement support level and the support line of a descending parallel channel. The exact wave count is not entirely clear. BTC has been increasing since the June 22 low of $28,600. However, the upward movement is clearly a three wave structure. Therefore, it’s unlikely to be the beginning of a new bullish impulse and is either a completed or partial corrective structure. However, the downward move does not look like the beginning of a bearish impulse but is likely part of a complex corrective structure. Therefore, it seems that another upward move is likely, fitting with the previously outlined parallel channel. The most likely count indicates that the entire movement since the June 22 low is corrective. In this possibility, the price is currently in the second portion of the correction, after which an upward move toward the range highs will transpire. The current price level is suitable for the initiation of a bounce, since it’s the 0.618 Fib retracement level.

And the goal is really to make it easier to create these non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services. So along with Square's latest project, another factor that could aid the adoption of Bitcoin-based DeFi is the Taproot upgrade that's slated for mid-November. And historically, the Bitcoin blockchain has been considered slower and less efficient than its Ethereum counterpart. So this [INAUDIBLE] to make it easy to use DeFi services on Bitcoin could ramp up adoption and provide greater competition to the Ethereum-based DeFi.

BTC," A new bitcoin law expected to be introduced into Paraguay’s legislature tomorrow will require cryptos to be registered with the country’s Undersecretariat of State Taxation, Decrypt reported Tuesday, citing a draft of the bill it said it obtained. “The purpose of this draft law is to establish legal certainty, financial and fiscal in the businesses derived from the production and commercialization of virtual assets,” a rough translation of the document reads. Decrypt reported that the bill was a leaked draft, without saying how it obtained it. The bill would also regulate crypto mining as well as trading through exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces where participants will be required to register as “obligated subjects,” according to Decrypt’s reporting. Related: Almost All Chinese Provinces Have Blockchain-Boosting Policies It’s a stark contrast to neighboring Latin American country El Salvador, which last month approved its own version of a Bitcoin Law designed to make the crypto legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. “It is important that companies can register these products within their accounting so that they can have their real valuation, additionally [it] helps to optimize the tax collection of this industry, finally giving traceability of what is produced in the country facilitating its tracking by supervisory authorities,” the document says. Specifically, the rationale of the bill states that crypto mining should be seen as an industrial activity under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce because of its use of capital, labor, machinery and construction of civil infrastructure. Congressman Carlos Rejala, who plans to present the bill, told CoinDesk last month the law would allow crypto mining or exchange companies to finance their Paraguayan operations with digital assets as well as remit dividends abroad and capitalize their crypto profits in domestic banks.

BTC,"Check back at 8:30 a.m. ET for the results Today, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Wasabi reports it has made significant progress toward the release of its Wasabi Wallet 2.0. Founded almost three years ago, Wasabi Wallet pools multiple users’ unspent transactions (UTXOs) into a single Bitcoin transaction using CoinJoin. CoinJoin is a trustless process that makes it difficult for third-party observers, or even participants, to trace funds and it significantly lowers transaction fees. In order to protect the anonymity of its users, Wasabi traffic runs through the Tor network, an online network that focuses on censorship resistance and anonymity, by default.  Wasabi Wallet 2.0 aims to improve the user interface of the wallet as well as introduce a more efficient coinjoin framework, which developers call WabiSabi. Related: Bitcoin Sell-Off Could Stabilize Around $30K Support “One of the biggest challenges was developing the software for more than just cypherpunks and people very well versed in Bitcoin,” said CTO David Molnar.  “It was difficult to get the developers and contributors to see the bigger picture, that we can only win the privacy war if we expand our vision to include all future Bitcoin users and not just the privacy advocates and cypherpunks.”  While the new UI will allow users to access “pleb-friendly,” frictionless and secure payments via Tor, WabiSabi boasts its own set of upgrades: Users will no longer need to run coins through multiple coinjoins in order to gain privacy. There will no longer be a minimum (0.1 BTC) or maximum (7 BTC) denomination when using coinjoins; There will be improved block space efficiency, allowing more inputs into a single coinjoin transaction. This will lower fees for each user. Wasabi Wallet 2.0 has no defined launch date; however, the company has committed to and published three milestones: Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Preview will contain only the most fundamental features and will be used only on the Bitcoin testnet. This will be released in around 6-14 weeks. Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Release Candidate will include all features and will be available to the public for reviewing and testing. The team will work on this version until ”the quality of the software is sufficient.” Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Final Release (Series) will be the first version of the 2.0 series and the default when new users download the wallet.

BTC,"A look at on-chain indicators, more specifically the HODL Wave and RHODL ratio in order to determine the age of the coins that are currently being transacted. The HODL wave shows that coins that were held up to two years are moving, with an increase in selling from the three month to six month band. However, long-term holders are still accumulating. The HODL wave shows the time periods in which Bitcoin (BTC) has most recently moved. It does this by using different colors for coins that are being transacted in different time periods. Red, Orange and Yellow (warm colors) represent recently transacted BTC.  Light Yellow, Green and Blue (colder colors) represent BTC that has not transacted in a while.  Since the beginning of the BTC price decrease in May, there has been less selling (black line) by short-term coins, meaning those that have had their most recent transaction between 24 hours and one month. This either means that short-term holders are not selling, or that the coins which they bought more than a month ago have now matured, and they are capitulating after holding for more than a month. The increase (green line) in coins that were most recently transacted between one month and two years confirms the second possibility. Short-term holders who bought the April high held their coins for longer than a month, but have recently capitulated. However, the biggest change in spending behavior comes from the three to six month band. Coins that were bought three to six months ago were bought between Jan-22 – March 22 (rectangle). At the time, the BTC price was between $33,000 – $57,000. Those coins have now matured, and it seems that medium-term holders are now capitulating. While spending from this band was around 7% at the time, it is now at 34%. There is almost no change in the behavior of long-term holders, since they have yet to sell. To the contrary, long-term holders are still accumulating. This is evident by the increase in long-term holder supply (blue), even if some holders have started to see unrealized losses. Short-term holder supply in profit (dark red) is almost nonexistent, while short-term holder supply in loss (light red) is decreasing. The RHODL Ratio also provides a similar reading. It measures the percentage of short and long-term supply with the ratio of the one week and one-to-two year bands.

BTC,"Ameer and Raees Cajee, two brothers behind the Africrypt platform, have disappeared along with $3.6 billion in BTC bought with investors’ funds. Two South African brothers, Ameer and Raees Cajee, have reportedly disappeared, taking $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin with them. The incident would make it one of South Africa’s biggest ever incidents related to crypto. The total amount that’s been recorded as stolen is 69,000 BTC. The two brothers were the creators of a platform called Africrypt, which first showed signs of trouble earlier in the year. Investors hired a law firm to look into the case after Ameer Cajee said that the company was a victim of a hack in April. At the time, the company held over $4 billion worth of bitcoin. He also asked investors not to report the incident to authorities, which further raised signs of trouble. His purported explanation was that it would slow down the process of recovering the funds. However, soon after, investors hired the Hanekom Attorneys law firm to investigate the incident. Employees at the firm lost access to back-end platforms seven days before the founder revealed the alleged hack, according to the report. The country’s national police force has been assigned to the case, which has contacted crypto exchanges to ensure that the funds aren’t liquidated. However, the bitcoin has been sent through mechanisms that prevent tracing — tumblers and mixers and large pools of bitcoin, which is making it hard to track the funds. The company website has also been shut down. The Cajee brothers launched Africrypt in 2019, promising investors good returns for their money. This is not the first such incident to take place in South Africa, with another company involved in a $1.2 billion scam in 2020. One governmental group in South Africa has called for regulation of exchanges. The cryptocurrency market, while it has done much to curb scams, is still subject to some nefarious incidents. Exchanges are working together to ensure that hackers and fraudsters cannot liquidate their funds, but it does not form airtight security. Chainalysis, in its 2021 Crypto Crime Report, noted that illicit activity as measured by the amount of funds involved had reduced significantly since 2019, but remained an issue. It totaled over $10 billion in transaction volume. These numbers are what is spurring governments to put regulation in place and place better oversight measures on the market.

BTC,"Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson Partner, joined Yahoo Finance to discuss Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, getting banned by a UK regulator. [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: Investors keeping a close eye on Bitcoin and the crypto markets today. Two big headlines for you, a crackdown in the UK, UK regulators pushing for the ban of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. And then also here in the US, Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles kind of pouring cold water, saying that he was skeptical about the need for a US digital dollar. So we want to talk about what this means for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency really at large with Lisa Ellis. She is a partner at MoffettNathanson. And Lisa, let's just start with, I guess, the reaction in Bitcoin today because we just had the chart up on the screen. We still see Bitcoin moving to the upside, up another 5%. You would think news like this would weigh on the price of Bitcoin. What's going on here? LISA ELLIS: Yeah. It's because broader regulation of the crypto markets, while it may cause some temporary disruption, like when a huge exchange like Binance gets kicked out of the UK, it's, broadly speaking, viewed as a positive for the adoption of cryptocurrencies more broadly. So for example, crypto ETFs, something that, in the US, we've been eagerly awaiting the approval of crypto ETFs. One of the big things holding up the approval of something like crypto ETFs is the fact that the SEC has been uncomfortable with the regulation in these markets around the world. So a big regulator, like in the UK, taking a stance, even though it could have some initial disruption, is viewed as a step forward in the maturation of this space, which is needed, really, for it to continue to grow. BRIAN CHEUNG: Lisa, Brian Cheung here. I want to ask though about whether or not a lot of these regulatory headwinds are going to get resolved quickly because on one hand, yes, it's indeed, I guess, a good thing that you have a little bit more regulatory clarity and attention. But at the same time, you have regulators here in the United States kind of scrambling, pointing fingers, saying, who's even responsible for regulating all of this?

BTC,"Bitcoin (BTC) created a bearish engulfing candlestick on July 5 but did not break down the following day. It’s trading inside a longer-term range and a shorter-term symmetrical triangle. BTC created a bearish engulfing candlestick on July 5. The next day, it attempted to initiate an upward move but only left a long upper wick in place (red icon). However, the MACD did not give a bearish reversal signal, creating a higher momentum bar instead. In addition, the Stochastic oscillator made a bullish cross. The closest support and resistance levels are found at $32,000 and $40,550. The six-hour chart is similarly undecided. It’s possible that BTC is trading inside a symmetrical triangle, though the resistance line of the channel has not been validated enough times. The symmetrical triangle is normally considered a neutral pattern. Technical indicators are also undecided. The MACD is at the 0-line while the RSI is freely moving above and below 50, a common sign of an undetermined trend. The wave count is currently unclear. Due to the presence of the triangle, it does make sense that the movement is part of the X wave of a complex corrective structure. The previously outlined bearish count in which the current movement is a 1-2/1-2 wave structure is becoming less likely. This is due to the failure to initiate a sharp downward movement after the breakdown from the channel. On the contrary, BTC is in the process of reclaiming the support line of the channel instead. While it is technically still possible, it would be validated with a breakout from the descending resistance line connecting the highs of wave 2 (black) and sub-wave (red) 2.

BTC,"MicroStrategy said Monday it bought about 13,005 bitcoins for $489 million in cash at an average price of roughly $37,617 inclusive of fees and expenses.  The business-intelligence software company now holds some 105,085 bitcoins, which were acquired for a total of $2.74 billion. That’s an average purchase price of $26,080 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. Given MicroStrategy paid a per-coin price of $37,617, the company’s purchase is already underwater with the leading cryptocurrency currently trading at about $32,000. Should the price of bitcoin not fully recover to the purchase price by the end of June 30, MicroStrategy will have to write the value of the newly purchased bitcoin down to the price at quarter end. Were the quarter to end right now, with bitcoin at $32,000, the value of that $489 million in bitcoin would have to be reduced about $73 million to $416 million. A call to MicroStrategy wasn’t immediately returned. CEO Michael Saylor has made bitcoin acquisition a second mandate for his 32-year-old company. Its other business is developing software. The purchase follows MicroStrategy’s raising of $500 million from the sale of debt to fund more bitcoin buying. As the company subsequently filed to sell $1 billion in shares to help buy even more of the leading cryptocurrency, we likely will see another purchase soon.

BTC," (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s shares have become less correlated with those of large U.S. technology companies ahead of the electric-vehicle maker’s earnings report and Bitcoin may be the reason why. The 20-day correlation between Tesla’s stock price and the Nasdaq 100 index has fallen from 0.83 on June 17 to 0.14 as of Wednesday. A decline can also be found in the relationship between the EV company’s shares and the NYSE FANG+ index, which includes the biggest tech firms such as Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. Tesla reports earnings on July 26. “Tesla is highly correlated to megacap tech” and “this relationship has really decoupled in the near term,” Amy Wu Silverman, derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said in emailed comments. “When I ask around, the feedback I get is that this is related to their Bitcoin exposure and how it will have to be accounted for when they report earnings.” Tesla in February disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin after favorable comments about the largest cryptocurrency from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. The move sparked speculation that other companies would follow -- though few have. Tesla has since sold a portion of the holdings, and Musk has emerged as a critic of Bitcoin for reasons including energy consumption. Tesla has dropped almost 4% this month, while the Nasdaq 100 is up more than 2%. Bitcoin has dropped from a peak of almost $65,000 in mid-April to about $32,500 amid a broad retreat in investor appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Silverman noted that Tesla also has “extremely steep” skew, a measure of how expensive bearish options are relative to bullish ones. “This is highly unusual for Tesla which spends a lot of the time with ‘inverted skews’ because both institutions and retail adore buying out-of-the-money call options in the name,” she said. Those looking for bearish trades might do well to use put spreads to take advantage of the high skew, Silverman added.

Bitcoin prices (BTC-USD) pared losses to trade back above $32,000 after setting a five-month low of about $28,800 earlier this week. Stocks extended gains from Thursday following President Joe Biden's announcement that he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators. This helped catalyze a jump in cyclical shares including industrials and financials, with traders eying the additional federal spending on physical infrastructure and other initiatives. The deal would include about $600 billion in new federal spending on investments for new roads, clean energy and other projects, and cost nearly $1 trillion in total over the next five years. It would be funded via provisions including stronger tax collections enforcements for the wealthy, and wireless spectrum auctions and strategic petroleum reserve sales.  ""The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective,"" Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance.

BTC,"This week’s price movements for Bitcoin (BTC), gold, and our stock picks Nvidia and Far Peak. This has probably been the worst week yet, in what has already been a difficult period for Bitcoin (BTC). After hovering around resistance at $40,000 towards the end of last week, BTC began to sink back down, reaching $35,000 by June 19. Although it managed to edge back up to $36,000, even after falling to $34,000 on June 20. But by June 21, BTC’s price had fallen below $33,000, before spending hours below $30,000 for the first time this year. However, selling pressure at that point raised it back up to $34,000 on June 23, where it is currently trading. New York-based research house Fundstrat said the selling that began on June 21 was “largely driven by regulatory pressures from China”. Michael Saylor, chief executive of MicroStrategy, one of the biggest corporate proponents of bitcoin, agreed that China’s clampdown was a “dominant driver.” “This created a forced and rushed exodus of Chinese capital and mining from the bitcoin network,” he tweeted. Although the price of gold fell considerably towards the end of last week, it seems to have found support. After falling from $1,860 to $1,810 on June 16, gold fell further the following day to about $1,770. Although it pushed back up to $1,795 by June 18, it was back to $1,770 going into the weekend. However, on June 21 the price of gold rose to roughly $1,790. Over the next couple of days it channeled between that price level and $1,780 where it is currently trading. The gold market is trying to find a balance between an overly ‘hawkish’ pricing of Fed interest rate hikes if inflation proves to be transitory, which would support gold, and a Fed that would act if inflation persists, TD Securities commodity strategist Daniel Ghali said. If the Fed does step in, it would translate into a more “balanced narrative” from the central bank than in the past, pushing gold into a “broader range,” Ghali added.

BTC,"Bitcoin (BTC) did not move substantially in either direction last week, failing to assert the direction of the trend. Its failure to break down in the short-term and subsequent bounce could mean that the current movement is not corrective, thus indicating that the low is in. The movement in the next few days will be crucial in determining the future trend. During the week of June 28-July 5, BTC did not move significantly in either direction. On the contrary, it ranged between $32,699 and $36,660. It’s still trading above the long-term horizontal support level of $32,600, and has created several long lower wicks below it. However, technical indicators in the weekly time frame are still bearish. The MACD is negative, the RSI has crossed below 50, and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bearish cross. The daily chart shows that BTC has been trading inside a range between $31,400 and $40,550 since May 19. The latter is also the 0.382 Fib retracement resistance level and could coincide with a descending resistance line, depending on when it’s reached. BTC bounced at the support area on June 22, created a higher low on June 26, and has been moving upwards since. However, technical indicators are not bullish yet. The MACD signal line is negative and the RSI is below 50. However, both are increasing. In addition to this, the Stochastic oscillator is very close to making a bullish cross (green circle). There are two potential wave counts in play. The bearish count suggests that BTC is still in a bearish impulse, one that has been ongoing since the all-time high of $64,895 from April 14. If the count is correct, BTC would currently be in sub-wave two (black) of wave five (orange). A potential target for the bottom of the move is found near $19,800. BTC completed sub-wave two (red) yesterday near the 0.786 Fib retracement resistance level of $33,800. It failed to reach the middle of the channel and broke down instead. Therefore, for the count to remain valid, BTC would have to break down from the channel soon with a sharp downward movement. The bullish count indicates that the upward movement is a leading diagonal instead. In this case, BTC would reach a high near $37,500, before breaking down. Nevertheless, the increase would be a part of wave A (orange) of an A-B-C corrective structure, indicating that the local low","Technical indicators are not bullish yet, but a bullish cross is possible.",NEGATIVE,0.6376343369483948

ETH has been moving upwards since reaching a low of $1,700 on June 22. So far, it has reached a high of $2,410 before falling. The decrease caused a breakdown from an ascending wedge. Currently, ETH is trading just above the 0.618 Fib retracement support level at $1,968. It’s possible that the wedge was part of a leading diagonal pattern. If so, ETH would be expected to increase towards the $2,880 horizontal resistance area. XRP had been following a descending resistance line since June 1. It made four unsuccessful attempts at moving above the line before finally managing to break out on July 4. After two days, it returned and validated the line as support (green icon).

BTC,"Bitcoin breaks above $35,000 as whales cause the biggest daily accumulation spike of 2021 with 60,000 worth of BTC being purchased.  For the first time in weeks, bitcoin managed to gain over the weekend. The crypto has climbed over 5% between Saturday and Sunday. One of the key reasons why bitcoin is up over the weekend could be credited to a surge in buying from whales. According to on-chain analysis company Santiment, whales have purchased 60,000 bitcoin in one day. In a recent tweet, Santiment stated “Bitcoin whale addresses holding between 100 to 10k BTC kicked off July with a 60k BTC accumulation spike, the highest daily spike of 2021. These addresses hold 9.12M coins combined after holding 100k less BTC just 6 weeks ago.” Source: Santiment The chart clearly indicates that major bitcoin holders are now accumulating sizable amounts of bitcoin. Most notably, the whales have accumulated over 100,000 coins over the past six weeks alone. The increase in bitcoin price as well as the accumulation of bitcoin by whales corresponds with the recent decline in mining difficulty. This week saw bitcoin mining difficulty drop by a staggering 28% in its biggest single adjustment in history. The adjustment saw the hash rate also hit a new 19-month low of 87.6 TH/s. While a declining hash rate may worry some, it is not entirely indicative of price action. While previously reported, bitcoin’s hash rate has been declining along with active addresses since bitcoin reached its all-time high around $64,000. Bitcoin demand has steadily been increasing as liquidity declines. China continues its efforts to thwart bitcoin mining within the country, forcing major mining operations to move overseas or shut down completely. The decline in hash rate is directly related to bitcoin miners in China shutting down operations. However, the low hash rate is having no negative effect on the price of bitcoin currently. Which at the time of writing is currently sitting at $35,516. Related Quotes Blockchain data shows wealthy investors are coming back to the bitcoin market.

BTC,"(Bloomberg) -- Strategists are struggling to see a turnaround ahead for Bitcoin, at least for now, as the digital coin looks to consolidate above the $30,000 level. The near-term setup is “challenging,” a JPMorgan Chase & Co. team including Josh Younger and Veronica Mejia Bustamante wrote in a note Friday, while Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC’s David Grider recommended reducing risk or buying some protection. The JPMorgan team said blockchain data suggests recent cryptocurrency sales were made to cover losses and that “there is likely still an overhang of underwater positions which need to be cleared through the market.” Bitcoin has roughly halved from a peak near $65,000 in April, hurt by a cryptocurrency clampdown in China, tightening regulatory scrutiny elsewhere and concerns that the servers underpinning the virtual coin consume too much energy. The prospect of reduced emergency stimulus amid the recovery from the pandemic may also be an obstacle for the most speculative investments. Still, the JPMorgan strategists pointed to stability in the Bitcoin futures market as a positive factor, alongside the possibility of increased production costs as China’s crackdown pushes Bitcoin mining abroad. Some researchers argue the marginal production cost plays an important role in Bitcoin prices. So while the “cryptocurrency market shows signs that it is not yet healthy, it does also appear to be beginning the process of healing,” they wrote. The largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 6.5% to $33,329 on Sunday, snapping a two-day drop. Other coins rallied too, with Ether up more than 5%. Some chart watchers view the $30,000 level as key for Bitcoin, contending a decline below it could open the way to retreat to $20,000. Grider, lead digital asset strategist at Fundstrat, noted that a large short position has been building again on the crypto exchange Bitfinex -- and said the last time there was a similar situation, negative news out of China took prices lower.

BTC,"An indicator that has historically marked major price bottoms is pointing to a renewed flow of capital into bitcoin. The stablecoin supply ratio oscillator created by analyst Willy Woo and tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has risen from a 12-month low of -2.6 to -1.9 in the past four weeks. The recovery indicates capital has been flowing from stablecoins into bitcoin, Glassnode tweeted Thursday. In other words, bargain hunters look to have employed stablecoins to buy the dip in bitcoin and broader crypto markets. Related: How One Fund Used the Carry Trade to Beat Bitcoin Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with value tied to an external reference like the U.S. dollar. They are essentially proxies for fiat currencies, offering a price-stability advantage that other digital assets do not have, and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. The total market capitalization of stablecoins has surged 10-fold year-over-year to more than $100 billion, according to Messari. The stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) is the ratio of the bitcoin supply and the stablecoin supply denoted in BTC. “When the ratio is low, the buying power for bitcoin is high, as the same amount of USD can buy relatively more BTC. Conversely, a high ratio means fiat has weak buying power,” Glassnode said in the explainer blog post. The stablecoin supply ratio oscillator helps traders identify extreme readings on the SSR and any impending trend change. The metric, however, doesn’t consider the fiat-based trades or bitcoin derivatives and is not a perfect indicator. Nevertheless, it has proved to be a reliable indicator of changes in the past. Related: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Fee Problem (and Solutions) For example, bitcoin’s previous bull runs, including the one seen in the final quarter of 2020, kicked off with a below -2 reading on the oscillator. So, the recent recovery could be a signal of an impending change of fortunes for bitcoin and broader crypto markets. Bitcoin is currently trading near $33,560, representing a 3% drop on the day. The leading cryptocurrency fell sharply in mid-May and has been restricted mainly to the $30,000 to $40,000 range ever since, barring the temporary dip to $29,000 earlier this week.

BTC," CoinDesk Global Macro Editor & CoinDesk TV Anchor Emily Parker joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss China’s crackdown on crypto. - Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Time for our Crypto Corner. Bitcoin has had quite a year, almost half of what it was at just about three months ago. And one big reason for the dramatic slide down for Bitcoin could be China's crackdown broadly on crypto. Let's talk about this more with Emily Parker. She's CoinDesk's Global Macro Editor. And Emily, just I guess maybe start off with wrapping up the story about what Chinese authorities have been doing over there. We know that they've been cracking down on Bitcoin mining. They've been discouraging banks and fintech players from getting into this space. But I guess, first of all, what are they doing specifically? And I guess why now? EMILY PARKER: Great questions. So this is part of a much longer narrative. China has been cracking down on cryptocurrency in various forms for many years. China is bullish on blockchain technology but wary of cryptocurrency. And one thing that's important to note is China does not ban Bitcoin. And China does not ban cryptocurrency. You can still hold Bitcoin in China. But they just make it harder for the average investor to enter the market. So first, they made it hard-- they shut down mainland exchanges. And they banned initial coin offerings, ICOs. But most recently, they've been cracking down on mining in China. China's a real center for Bitcoin mining. And they have also been basically instructing banks to stay away from cryptocurrency transactions. So those are the latest moves. It's all part of the continuous narrative. But there's definitely a sense that they mean business this time. AKIKO FUJITA: And Emily, so much of this discussion about the crackdown on Bitcoin in China has been run in parallel with the story that we've been following about China really trying to accelerate the adoption of the digital Yuan, which is, you know, as we anticipate, expected to have a big splash in the Olympics next year. Now how much of that is really tied to each other? Does China see the growth of Bitcoin coming at the expense of their own digital currency, or do you see them on separate tracks?

BTC,"Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which recently hit an all-time high above $64,000 (£46,484), is once again worth over $1tn.  The cryptocurrency has reached the milestone much faster than other tech giants including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL). A report compiled by CryptocParrot, a cryptocurrency trading simulator, found that bitcoin reached $1tn twice as fast as Amazon and more than three times faster than Amazon. Bitcoin took just 12 years to hit the $1trn mark, according to CryptoParrot. Apple needed 42 years to hit the milestone, meaning bitcoin got there 3.5 times faster than the iPhone maker. Amazon took 24 years, double the time it took bitcoin. Google got there in 21 years and Microsoft (MSFT) took almost half a century. Many market watchers bristle at comparisons between bitcoin's value and private company market caps. Tech companies like Google are, after all, limited stock businesses, whereas bitcoin is a decentralized financial network.  However, both depend on technological adoption for their value. Market capitalisation — the value of all bitcoin in circulation — is a good yardstick for measuring the asset's spectacular rise. Watch: What is bitcoin?

BTC,"BeinCrypto spoke to Alexander Höptner, CEO of BitMex, about the movement to mass bitcoin adoption and where BitMEX is headed next.  Höptner took on the position of CEO at the end of 2020. With a background as CEO of other companies, including Euwax AG and 1st Order, his experience made him a great choice for the exchange, which has been making headlines, both good and bad. He first entered the crypto space in 2013/2014. Starting with an interest in tokenization, he was led further down the rabbit hole and is now an avid hodler who doesn’t mind buying the dip. However, this doesn’t mean he isn’t for bitcoin as a viable currency. “At the moment there are simply too few options for paying. This is particularly difficult in Germany. It looks different in Switzerland and Asia. But as soon as there are a few real use cases, I will also use bitcoin in everyday life. I believe.”  This belief in bitcoin is echoed by BitMEX itself. Its latest plans include literally taking bitcoin to the moon. Höptner and his team are taking on Elon Musk who has said he would like to take dogecoin to the moon. “We are strong believers in bitcoin and then we had the chance to send the bitcoin to the moon. That is actually exactly our affair of the heart, to support bitcoin and with it the basic movement.” While these kinds of stunts gain a lot of attention, the interest in them speaks to the growth in participation overall. For Höptner, while there will be changes for crypto into the future, fundamentally, bitcoin and cryptos’ purposes will stay the same. “I think the protocols will look different and we will have different forms of tokens and cryptos, because technically this is also evolving. But the fundamental issue will always be there and it will completely change the entire world of work.” A key part of the future of cryptocurrencies and their development is research. BitMEX is invested in this, supporting the development and education. “There are only a few properly structured research fields on this topic. In other words, it is not yet set up by all of the research and development in the same way as other industries or technologies. That is why we said we have to support this within our modest framework.” To do this, BitMEX supports developers so they can devote themselves to their research “and don’t go into any start-up driven by money to ensure financial survival,”",Hptner says he will use bitcoin in everyday life.

[MUSIC PLAYING] AKIKO FUJITA: We are seeing Bitcoin rebound from its lows for the year, climbing back above that $30,000 handle. The cryptocurrency turned negative on the year yesterday on the back of some new headlines out of China with the PPOC summoning banks and payment services to close any loopholes on crypto trading. We also had the government over in the Sichuan province shutting down mining there. Our next guest says the crackdown in China is good news for the US. Let's bring in Peter Smith, Blockchain.com's co-founder and CEO. Peter, you've highlighted, or we've been talking about a lot about how the crackdown has been ongoing in China. But with the mining aspect now really front and center, to what extent do you think that that's going to propel more and more miners to come to the US? We've already seen the movement start. How much of that comes over here? PETER SMITH: Yeah. I think it's actually fantastic news for the Bitcoin ecosystem. You're going to see a diversification of mining operations around the world. We've been seeing that trend over the last two years, as large mines are built in Europe, the US, and a variety of other geographic locations. But that trend is going to accelerate hard now. And I think one of the things that concerned me the most about the crypto market was the concentration of Bitcoin mining in mainland China. And so I think this is going to be painful in the short term, as Chinese mining firms sell down a lot of their inventory of Bitcoin and move their operations overseas. But I think from a net perspective over the next three or four years, this is actually hugely positive for the Bitcoin ecosystem. ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah. And the other thing too, Peter, I mean, I guess it also, maybe to a lesser extent, addresses some of the sustainability concerns too out of China. There was that crackdown earlier in inner Mongolia that was mostly coal-powered miners. Sichuan was more hydropower, so it was maybe to a lesser extent. Really helps on the sustainability front.

BTC,"In 2016 a month’s bitcoin mining with a home computer would see approximately 0.1 BTC accumulated, or £2,479 ($3,428) at today's prices. However, it is impossible to profitably mine bitcoin with a home set-up today. Because of increased difficulty levels, after many years and many burnt-out graphics cards, a home miner would be lucky to accumulate 0.1 bitcoin. Bitcoin mining from home is not a feasible enterprise and best left to major players, like Bitfarms Ltd. (BITF.V), recently listed on the NASDAQ. However, many other mining alternatives can give passive, if not a full monthly income. But profitability is dependent on mining equipment, cryptocurrency volatility and electricity prices. In essence, cryptocurrency mining provides the two major functions that power this method of value transfer – one that does not need a centralised authority to record and verify transactions, and so has raised the eyebrows of the world's central banks. One function of the mining process is to add and verify transactions between users to the blockchain public ledger. The other function of the mining process is to produce new coins.
